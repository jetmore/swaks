App-swaks version 20201014.0
======================

App::swaks is a perl package which distributes the Swaks SMTP test
tool.  There's no real reason for this to be a perl package except
that it offers easy installation via cpan tooling on operating systems
which don't already package Swaks.

documentation, git repo, etc.
