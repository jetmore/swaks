# Swaks - Swiss Army Knife for SMTP

Swaks is a featureful, flexible, scriptable, transaction-oriented SMTP test tool written and maintained by [John Jetmore].

Currently Swaks is hosted in a private svn repository.  I am creating this github repository to give Swaks some sort of official presence on github.

The official project page is http://jetmore.org/john/code/swaks/

# Download

The latest version of Swaks is **20170101.0**, which can be downloaded as a [package] or a [standalone script].

There is also a [versions page] which lists every released version of Swaks, complete with changelogs and download links.
