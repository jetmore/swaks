NAME
    Swaks - Swiss Army Knife SMTP, the all-purpose SMTP transaction tester

DESCRIPTION
    Swaks' primary design goal is to be a flexible, scriptable,
    transaction-oriented SMTP test tool. It handles SMTP features and
    extensions such as TLS, authentication, and pipelining; multiple version
    of the SMTP protocol including SMTP, ESMTP, and LMTP; and multiple
    transport methods including UNIX-domain sockets, internet-domain
    sockets, and pipes to spawned processes. Options can be specified in
    environment variables, configuration files, and the command line
    allowing maximum configurability and ease of use for operators and
    scripters.

QUICK START
    Deliver a standard test email to user@example.com on port 25 of
    test-server.example.net:

         swaks --to user@example.com --server test-server.example.net

    Deliver a standard test email, requiring CRAM-MD5 authentication as user
    me@example.com. An "X-Test" header will be added to the email body. The
    authentication password will be prompted for if it cannot be obtained
    from your .netrc file.

         swaks --to user@example.com --from me@example.com --auth CRAM-MD5 --auth-user me@example.com --header-X-Test "test email"

    Test a virus scanner using EICAR in an attachment. Don't show the
    message DATA part.:

         swaks -t user@example.com --attach - --server test-server.example.com --suppress-data </path/to/eicar.txt

    Test a spam scanner using GTUBE in the body of an email, routed via the
    MX records for example.com:

         swaks --to user@example.com --body /path/to/gtube/file

    Deliver a standard test email to user@example.com using the LMTP
    protocol via a UNIX domain socket file

         swaks --to user@example.com --socket /var/lda.sock --protocol LMTP

    Report all the recipients in a text file that are non-verifiable on a
    test server:

         for E in `cat /path/to/email/file`
         do
             swaks --to $E --server test-server.example.com --quit-after RCPT --hide-all
             [ $? -ne 0 ] && echo $E
         done

TERMS AND CONVENTIONS
    This document tries to be consistent and specific in its use of the
    following terms to reduce confusion.

    Target
        The target of a transaction is the thing that Swaks connects to.
        This generic term is used throughout the documentation because most
        other terms improperly imply something about the transport being
        used.

    Transport
        The transport is the underlying method used to connect to the
        target.

    Transaction
        A transaction is the opening of a connection over a transport to a
        target and using a messaging protocol to attempt to deliver a
        message.

    Protocol
        The protocol is the application language used to communicate with
        the target. This document uses SMTP to speak generically of all
        three supported protocols unless it states that it is speaking of
        the specific 'SMTP' protocol and excluding the others.

    Message
        SMTP protocols exist to transfer messages, a set of bytes in an
        agreed-upon format that has a sender and a recipient.

    Envelope
        A message's envelope contains the "true" sender and receiver of a
        message. It can also be referred to as its components,
        envelope-sender and envelope-recipients. It is important to note
        that a messages envelope does not have to match its "To:" and
        "From:" headers.

    DATA
        The DATA portion of an SMTP transaction is the actual message that
        is being transported. It consists of both the message's headers and
        its body. DATA and body are sometimes used synonymously, but they
        are always two distinct things in this document.

    Headers
        A message's headers are defined as all the lines in the message's
        DATA section before the first blank line. They contain information
        about the email that will be displayed to the recipient such as
        "To:", "From:", "Subject:", etc. In this document headers will
        always be written with a capitalized first letter and a trailing
        colon.

    Body
        A message's body is the portion of its DATA section following the
        first blank line.

    Option
        An option is a flag which changes Swaks' behavior. Always called an
        option regardless of how it is provided. For instance,
        "--no-data-fixup" is an option.

    Argument
        When an option takes addition data beside the option itself, that
        additional data is called an argument. In "--quit-after
        <stop-point>'", "<stop-point>" is the argument to the "--quit-after"
        option.

    <literal-string>
        When used in the definition of an option, text that is inside of
        angle brackets ("<>") indicates a descriptive label for a value that
        the user should provide. For instance, "--quit-after <stop-point>"
        indicates that "<stop-point>" should be replaced with a valid
        stop-point value.

    [<optional-value>]
        When used in the definition of an option, text inside of square
        brackets ([]) indicates that the value is optional and can be
        omitted. For instance, "--to [<recipient>]" indicates that the
        "--to" option can be used with or without a specified "<recipient>".

OPTION PROCESSING
    To prevent potential confusion in this document a flag to Swaks is
    always referred to as an "option". If the option takes additional data,
    that additional data is referred to as an argument to the option. For
    example, "--from fred@example.com" might be provided to Swaks on the
    command line, with "--from" being the option and "fred@example.com"
    being "--from"'s argument.

    Options and arguments are the only way to provide information to Swaks.
    If Swaks finds data during option processing that is neither an option
    nor an option's argument, it will error and exit. For instance, if
    "--no-data-fixup 1" were found on the command line, this would result in
    an error because "--no-data-fixup" does not take an argument and
    therefore Swaks would not know what to do with 1.

    Options can be given to Swaks in three ways. They can be specified in a
    configuration file, in environment variables, and on the command line.
    Depending on the specific option and whether an argument is given to it,
    Swaks may prompt the user for the argument.

    When Swaks evaluates its options, it first looks for a configuration
    file (either in a default location or specified with "--config"). Then
    it evaluates any options in environment variables. Finally, it evaluates
    command line options. At each round of processing, any options set
    earlier will be overridden. Additionally, any option can be prefixed
    with "no-" to cause Swaks to forget that the variable had previously
    been set (either in an earlier round, or earlier in the same round).
    This capability is necessary because many options treat
    defined-but-no-argument differently than not-defined.

    As a general rule, if the same option is given multiple time, the last
    time it is given is the one that will be used. This applies to both
    intra-method (if "--from user1@example.com --from user2@example.com" is
    given, "user2@example.com" will be used) and inter-method (if "from
    user1@example.com" is given in a config file and "--from
    user2@example.com" is given on the command line, "user2@example.com"
    will be used)

    Each option definition ends with a parenthetical synopsis of how the
    option behaves. The following codes can be used

    Arg-None, Arg-Optional, Arg-Required
        These three codes are mutually exclusive and describe whether or not
        the option takes an argument. Note that this does not necessarily
        describe whether the argument is required to be specified directly,
        but rather whether an argument is required eventually. For instance,
        "--to" is labeled as Arg-Required, but it is legal to specify "--to"
        on the command line without an argument. This is because Swaks can
        prompt for the required argument if it is not directly provided.

    From-Prompt
        An option labeled with From-Prompt will prompt the user
        interactively for the argument if none is provided.

    From-File
        An option labeled with From-File will handle arguments as files in
        certain situations.

        If the initial argument is "-", the final argument is the contents
        of "STDIN". Multiple options can all specify "STDIN", but the same
        content will be used for each of them.

        If the initial argument is prefixed with "@", the argument will be
        treated as a path to a file. The file will be opened and the
        contents will be used as the final argument. If the contents of the
        file can't be read, Swaks will exit. To specify a literal value
        starting with an "@", use two "@" symbols. The first will be
        stripped.

    Sensitive
        If an option marked Sensitive attempts to prompt the user for an
        argument and the "--protect-prompt" option is set, Swaks will
        attempt to mask the user input from being echoed on the terminal.
        Swaks tries to mask the input in several ways, but if none of them
        work program flow will continue with unmasked input.

    Deprecated
        An option labeled Deprecated has been officially deprecated and will
        be removed in a future release. See the "DEPRECATIONS" section of
        this documentation for details about the deprecations.

    The exact mechanism and format for using each of the types is listed
    below.

    CONFIGURATION FILES
        A configuration file can be used to set commonly-used or abnormally
        verbose options. By default, Swaks looks in order for
        $SWAKS_HOME/.swaksrc, $HOME/.swaksrc, and $LOGDIR/.swaksrc. If one
        of those is found to exist (and "--config" has not been used) that
        file is used as the configuration file.

        Additionally, a configuration file in a non-default location can be
        specified using "--config". If this is set and not given an argument
        Swaks will not use any configuration file, including any default
        file. If "--config" points to a readable file, it is used as the
        configuration file, overriding any default that may exist. If it
        points to a non-readable file an error will be shown and Swaks will
        exit.

        A set of "portable" defaults can also be created by adding options
        to the end of the Swaks program file. As distributed, the last line
        of Swaks should be "__END__". Any lines added after "__END__" will
        be treated as the contents of a configuration file. This allows a
        set of user preferences to be automatically copied from server to
        server in a single file.

        If configuration files have not been explicitly turned off, the
        "__END__" config is always read. Only one other configuration file
        will ever be used per single invocation of Swaks, even if multiple
        configuration files are specified. If the "__END__" config and
        another config are to be read, the "__END__" config will be
        processed first. Specifying the "--config" option with no argument
        turns off the processing of both the "__END__" config and any actual
        config files.

        In a configuration file lines beginning with a hash ("#") are
        ignored. All other lines are assumed to be an option to Swaks, with
        the leading dash or dashes optional. Everything after an option
        line's first space is assumed to be the option's argument and is not
        shell processed. Therefore, quoting is usually unneeded and will be
        included literally in the argument.

        There is a subtle difference between providing an option with no
        argument and providing an option with an empty argument. If an
        option line does not have a space, the entire line is treated as an
        option and there is no argument. If the line ends in a single space,
        it will be processed as an option with an empty argument. So, "apt"
        will be treated as "--apt", but "apt " will be treated as
        "--apt ''".

        Here is an example of the contents of a configuration file:

            # always use this sender, no matter server or logged in user
            --from fred@example.com
            # I prefer my test emails have a pretty from header.  Note
            # the lack of dashes on option and lack of quotes around
            # entire argument.
            h-From: "Fred Example" <fred@example.com>

        Options specific to configuration file:

        --config [<config-file>]
            This option provides a path to a specific configuration file to
            be used. If specified with no argument, no automatically-found
            configuration file (via $HOME, etc, or "__END__") will be
            processed. If the argument is a valid file, that file will be
            used as the configuration file (after "__END__" config). If
            argument is not a valid, readable file, Swaks will error and
            exit. This option can be specified multiple times, but only the
            first time it is specified (in environment variable and the
            command line search order) will be used. (Arg-Optional)

    CONFIGURATION ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
        Options can be supplied via environment variables. The variables are
        in the form $SWAKS_OPT_name, where "name" is the name of the option
        that would be specified on the command line. Because dashes aren't
        allowed in environment variable names in most UNIX-ish shells, no
        leading dashes should be used and any dashes inside the option's
        name should be replaced with underscores. The following would create
        the same options shown in the configuration file example:

            $ SWAKS_OPT_from='fred@example.com'
            $ SWAKS_OPT_h_From='"Fred Example" <fred@example.com>'

        Setting a variable to an empty value is the same as specifying it on
        the command line with no argument. For instance, setting
        <SWAKS_OPT_server=""> would cause Swaks to prompt the user for the
        server to which to connect at each invocation.

        Because there is no inherent order in options provided by setting
        environment variables, the options are sorted before being
        processed. This is not a great solution, but it at least defines the
        behavior, which would be otherwise undefined. As an example, if both
        $SWAKS_OPT_from and $SWAKS_OPT_f were set, the value from
        $SWAKS_OPT_from would be used, because it sorts after $SWAKS_OPT_f.
        Also as a result of not having an inherent order in environment
        processing, unsetting options with the "no-" prefix is unreliable.
        It works if the option being turned off sorts before "no-", but
        fails if it sorts after. Because "no-" is primarily meant to operate
        between config types (for instance, unsetting from the command line
        an option that was set in a config file), this is not likely to be a
        problem.

        In addition to setting the equivalent of command line options,
        $SWAKS_HOME can be set to a directory containing the default
        .swaksrc to be used.

    COMMAND LINE OPTIONS
        The final method of supplying options to Swaks is via the command
        line. The options behave in a manner consistent with most UNIX-ish
        command line programs. Many options have both a short and long form
        (for instance "-s" and "--server"). By convention short options are
        specified with a single dash and long options are specified with a
        double-dash. This is only a convention and either prefix will work
        with either type.

        The following demonstrates the example shown in the configuration
        file and environment variable sections:

            $ swaks --from fred@example.com --h-From: '"Fred Example" <fred@example.com>'

TRANSPORTS
    Swaks can connect to a target via UNIX pipes ("pipes"), UNIX domain
    sockets ("UNIX sockets"), or internet domain sockets ("network
    sockets"). Connecting via network sockets is the default behavior.
    Because of the singular nature of the transport used, each set of
    options in the following section is mutually exclusive. Specifying more
    than one of "--server", "--pipe", or "--socket" will result in an error.
    Mixing other options between transport types will only result in the
    irrelevant options being ignored. Below is a brief description of each
    type of transport and the options that are specific to that transport
    type.

    NETWORK SOCKETS
        This transport attempts to deliver a message via TCP/IP, the
        standard method for delivering SMTP. This is the default transport
        for Swaks. If none of "--server", "--pipe", or "--socket" are given
        then this transport is used and the target server is determined from
        the recipient's domain (see "--server" below for more details).

        This transport requires the IO::Socket module which is part of the
        standard Perl distribution. If this module is not loadable,
        attempting to use this transport will result in an error and program
        termination.

        IPv6 is supported when the IO::Socket::INET6 module is present.

        -s, --server [<target-server>[:<port>]]
            Explicitly tell Swaks to use network sockets and specify the
            hostname or IP address to which to connect, or prompt if no
            argument is given. If this option is not given and no other
            transport option is given, the target mail server is determined
            from the appropriate DNS records for the domain of the recipient
            email address using the Net::DNS module. If Net::DNS is not
            available Swaks will attempt to connect to localhost to deliver.
            The target port can optionally be set here. Supported formats
            for this include SERVER:PORT (supporting names and IPv4
            addresses); [SERVER]:PORT and SERVER/PORT (supporting names,
            IPv4 and IPv6 addresses). See also "--copy-routing".
            (Arg-Required, From-Prompt)

        -p, --port [<port>]
            Specify which TCP port on the target is to be used, or prompt if
            no argument is listed. The argument can be a service name (as
            retrieved by getservbyname(3)) or a port number. The default
            port is smtp/25 unless influenced by the "--protocol" or
            "--tls-on-connect" options. (Arg-Required, From-Prompt)

        -li, --local-interface [<local-interface>[:<port>]]
            Use argument as the local interface for the outgoing SMTP
            connection, or prompt user if no argument given. Argument can be
            an IP address or a hostname. Default action is to let the
            operating system choose the local interface. See "--server" for
            additional comments on :<port> format. (Arg-Required,
            From-Prompt)

        -lp, --local-port, --lport [<port>]
            Specify the outgoing port from which to originate the
            transaction. The argument can be a service name (as retrieved by
            getservbyname(3)) or a port number. If this option is not
            specified the system will pick an ephemeral port. Note that
            regular users cannot specify some ports. (Arg-Required,
            From-Prompt)

        --copy-routing <domain>
            The argument is interpreted as the domain part of an email
            address and it is used to find the target server using the same
            logic that would be used to look up the target server for a
            recipient email address. See "--to" option for more details on
            how the target is determined from the email domain.
            (Arg-Required)

        -4, -6
            Force IPv4 or IPv6. (Arg-None)

    UNIX SOCKETS
        This transport method attempts to deliver messages via a UNIX-domain
        socket file. This is useful for testing MTA/MDAs that listen on
        socket files (for instance, testing LMTP delivery to Cyrus). This
        transport requires the IO::Socket module which is part of the
        standard Perl distribution. If this module is not loadable,
        attempting to use this transport will result in an error and program
        termination.

        --socket [<socket-file>]
            This option takes as its argument a UNIX-domain socket file. If
            Swaks is unable to open this socket it will display an error and
            exit. (Arg-Required, From-Prompt)

    PIPES
        This transport attempts to spawn a process and communicate with it
        via pipes. The spawned program must be prepared to behave as a mail
        server over "STDIN"/"STDOUT". Any MTA designed to operate from
        inet/xinet should support this. In addition, some MTAs provide
        testing modes that can be communicated with via "STDIN"/"STDOUT".
        This transport can be used to automate that testing. For example, if
        you implemented DNSBL checking with Exim and you wanted to make sure
        it was working, you could run "swaks --pipe "exim -bh 127.0.0.2"".
        Ideally, the process you are talking to should behave exactly like
        an SMTP server on "STDIN" and "STDOUT". Any debugging should be sent
        to "STDERR", which will be directed to your terminal. In practice,
        Swaks can generally handle some debug on the child's "STDOUT", but
        there are no guarantees on how much it can handle.

        This transport requires the IPC::Open2 module which is part of the
        standard Perl distribution. If this module is not loadable,
        attempting to use this transport will result in an error and program
        termination.

        --pipe [<command-and-arguments>]
            Provide a process name and arguments to the process. Swaks will
            attempt to spawn the process and communicate with it via pipes.
            If the argument is not an executable Swaks will display an error
            and exit. (Arg-Required, From-Prompt)

PROTOCOL OPTIONS
    These options are related to the protocol layer.

    -t, --to [<email-address>[,<email-address>[,...]]]
        Tells Swaks to use argument(s) as the envelope-recipient for the
        email, or prompt for recipient if no argument provided. If multiple
        recipients are provided and the recipient domain is needed to
        determine routing the domain of the last recipient provided is used.

        There is no default value for this option. If no recipients are
        provided via any means, user will be prompted to provide one
        interactively. The only exception to this is if a "--quit-after"
        value is provided which will cause the SMTP transaction to be
        terminated before the recipient is needed. (Arg-Required,
        From-Prompt)

    -f, --from [<email-address>]
        Use argument as envelope-sender for email, or prompt user if no
        argument specified. The string "<>" can be supplied to mean the null
        sender. If user does not specify a sender address a default value is
        used. The domain-part of the default sender is a best guess at the
        fully-qualified domain name of the local host. The method of
        determining the local-part varies. On Windows, "Win32::LoginName()"
        is used. On UNIX-ish platforms, the $LOGNAME environment variable is
        used if it is set. Otherwise getpwuid(3) is used. See also
        "--force-getpwuid". If Swaks cannot determine a local hostname and
        the sender address is needed for the transaction, Swaks will error
        and exit. In this case, a valid string must be provided via this
        option. (Arg-Required, From-Prompt)

    --ehlo, --lhlo, -h, --helo [<helo-string>]
        String to use as argument to HELO/EHLO/LHLO command, or prompt user
        if no argument is specified. If this option is not used a best guess
        at the fully-qualified domain name of the local host is used. If
        Swaks cannot determine a local hostname and the helo string is
        needed for the transaction, Swaks will error and exit. In this case,
        a valid string must be provided via this option. (Arg-Required,
        From-Prompt)

    -q, --quit, --quit-after <stop-point>
        Point at which the transaction should be stopped. When the requested
        stopping point is reached in the transaction, and provided that
        Swaks has not errored out prior to reaching it, Swaks will send
        "QUIT" and attempt to close the connection cleanly. These are the
        valid arguments and notes about their meaning. (Arg-Required)

        CONNECT, BANNER
            Terminate the session after receiving the greeting banner from
            the target.

        FIRST-HELO, FIRST-EHLO, FIRST-LHLO
            In a STARTTLS (but not tls-on-connect) session, terminate the
            transaction after the first of two HELOs. In a non-STARTTLS
            transaction, behaves the same as HELO (see below).

        XCLIENT
            Quit after XCLIENT is sent.

        STARTTLS, TLS
            Quit the transaction immediately following TLS negotiation. Note
            that this happens in different places depending on whether
            STARTTLS or tls-on-connect are used. This always quits after the
            point where TLS would have been negotiated, regardless of
            whether it was attempted.

        HELO, EHLO, LHLO
            In a STARTTLS or XCLIENT session, quit after the second HELO.
            Otherwise quit after the first and only HELO.

        AUTH
            Quit after authentication. This always quits after the point
            where authentication would have been negotiated, regardless of
            whether it was attempted.

        MAIL, FROM
            Quit after MAIL FROM: is sent.

        RCPT, TO
            Quit after RCPT TO: is sent.

    --da, --drop-after <stop-point>
        The option is similar to "--quit-after", but instead of trying to
        cleanly shut down the session it simply terminates the session. This
        option accepts the same stop-points as "--quit-after" and
        additionally accepts DATA and DOT, detailed below. (Arg-Required)

        DATA
            Quit after DATA is sent.

        DOT Quit after the final '.' of the message is sent.

    --das, --drop-after-send <stop-point>
        This option is similar to "--drop-after", but instead of dropping
        the connection after reading a response to the stop-point, it drops
        the connection immediately after sending stop-point. It accepts the
        same stop-points as "--drop-after". (Arg-Required)

    --timeout [<time>]
        Use argument as the SMTP transaction timeout, or prompt user if no
        argument given. Argument can either be a pure digit, which will be
        interpreted as seconds, or can have a specifier s, m, or h (5s = 5
        seconds, 3m = 180 seconds, 1h = 3600 seconds). As a special case, 0
        means don't timeout the transactions. Default value is 30s.
        (Arg-Required, From-Prompt)

    --protocol <protocol>
        Specify which protocol to use in the transaction. Valid options are
        shown in the table below. Currently the 'core' protocols are SMTP,
        ESMTP, and LMTP. By using variations of these protocol types one can
        tersely specify default ports, whether authentication should be
        attempted, and the type of TLS connection that should be attempted.
        The default protocol is ESMTP. The following table demonstrates the
        available arguments to "--protocol" and the options each sets as a
        side effect. (Arg-Required)

        SMTP
            HELO, "-p 25"

        SSMTP
            EHLO->HELO, "-tlsc -p 465"

        SSMTPA
            EHLO->HELO, "-a -tlsc -p 465"

        SMTPS
            HELO, "-tlsc -p 465"

        ESMTP
            EHLO->HELO, "-p 25"

        ESMTPA
            EHLO->HELO, "-a -p 25"

        ESMTPS
            EHLO->HELO, "-tls -p 25"

        ESMTPSA
            EHLO->HELO, "-a -tls -p 25"

        LMTP
            LHLO, "-p 24"

        LMTPA
            LHLO, "-a -p 24"

        LMTPS
            LHLO, "-tls -p 24"

        LMTPSA
            LHLO, "-a -tls -p 24"

    --pipeline
        If the remote server supports it, attempt SMTP PIPELINING (RFC
        2920). (Arg-None)

    --prdr
        If the server supports it, attempt Per-Recipient Data Response
        (PRDR) (<https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-hall-prdr-00.txt>). PRDR
        is not yet standardized, but MTAs have begun implementing the
        proposal. (Arg-None)

    --force-getpwuid
        Tell Swaks to use the getpwuid method of finding the default sender
        local-part instead of trying $LOGNAME first. (Arg-None)

TLS / ENCRYPTION
    These are options related to encrypting the transaction. These have been
    tested and confirmed to work with all three transport methods. The
    Net::SSLeay module is used to perform encryption when it is requested.
    If this module is not loadable Swaks will either ignore the TLS request
    or error out, depending on whether the request was optional. STARTTLS is
    defined as an extension in the ESMTP protocol and will be unavailable if
    "--protocol" is set to a variation of SMTP. Because it is not defined in
    the protocol itself, "--tls-on-connect" is available for any protocol
    type if the target supports it.

    A local certificate is not required for a TLS connection to be
    negotiated. However, some servers use client certificate checking to
    verify that the client is allowed to connect. Swaks can be told to use a
    specific local certificate using the "--tls-cert" and "--tls-key"
    options.

    -tls
        Require connection to use STARTTLS. Exit if TLS not available for
        any reason (not advertised, negotiations failed, etc). (Arg-None)

    -tlso, --tls-optional
        Attempt to use STARTTLS if available, continue with normal
        transaction if TLS was unable to be negotiated for any reason. Note
        that this is a semi-useless option as currently implemented because
        after a negotiation failure the state of the connection is unknown.
        In some cases, like a version mismatch, the connection should be
        left as plaintext. In others, like a verification failure, the
        server-side may think that it should continue speaking TLS while the
        client thinks it is plaintext. There may be an attempt to add more
        granular state detection in the future, but for now just be aware
        that odd things may happen with this option if the TLS negotiation
        is attempted and fails. (Arg-None)

    -tlsos, --tls-optional-strict
        Attempt to use STARTTLS if available. Proceed with transaction if
        TLS is negotiated successfully or STARTTLS not advertised. If
        STARTTLS is advertised but TLS negotiations fail, treat as an error
        and abort transaction. Due to the caveat noted above, this is a much
        saner option than "--tls-optional". (Arg-None)

    -tlsc, --tls-on-connect
        Initiate a TLS connection immediately on connection. Following
        common convention, if this option is specified the default port
        changes from 25 to 465, though this can still be overridden with the
        --port option. (Arg-None)

    -tlsp, --tls-protocol <tls-version-specification>
        Specify which protocols to use (or not use) when negotiating TLS. At
        the time of this writing, the available protocols are sslv2, sslv3,
        tlsv1, tlsv1_1, tlsv1_2, and tlsv1_3. The availability of these
        protocols is dependent on your underlying OpenSSL library, so not
        all of these may be available. The list of available protocols is
        shown in the output of "--dump" (assuming TLS is available at all).

        The specification string is a comma-delimited list of protocols that
        can be used or not used. For instance 'tlsv1,tlsv1_1' will only
        succeed if one of those two protocols is available on both the
        client and the server. Conversely, 'no_sslv2,no_sslv3' will attempt
        to negotiate any protocol except sslv2 and sslv3. The two forms of
        specification cannot be mixed. (Arg-Required)

    --tls-cipher <cipher-string>
        The argument to this option is passed to the underlying OpenSSL
        library to set the list of acceptable ciphers to the be used for the
        connection. The format of this string is opaque to Swaks and is
        defined in
        <http://www.openssl.org/docs/apps/ciphers.html#CIPHER_LIST_FORMAT>.
        A brief example would be "--tls-cipher '3DES:+RSA'". (Arg-Required)

    --tls-verify
        Tell Swaks to attempt to verify the server's certificate. If this
        option is set and the server's certificate is not verifiable (either
        using the system-default CA information, or custom CA information
        (see "--tls-ca-path")) TLS negotiation will not succeed. By default,
        Swaks does not attempt certificate verification. (Arg-None)

    --tls-ca-path <ca-location>
        Specify an alternate location for CA information for verifying
        server certificates. The argument can point to a file or directory.
        The default behavior is to use the underlying OpenSSL library's
        default information. (Arg-Required)

    --tls-cert <cert-file>
        Provide a path to a file containing the local certificate Swaks
        should use if TLS is negotiated. The file path argument is required.
        As currently implemented the certificate in the file must be in PEM
        format. Contact the author if there's a compelling need for ASN1. If
        this option is set, "--tls-key" is also required. (Arg-Required)

    --tls-key <key-file>
        Provide a path to a file containing the local private key Swaks
        should use if TLS is negotiated. The file path argument is required.
        As currently implemented the certificate in the file must be in PEM
        format. Contact the author if there's a compelling need for ASN1. If
        this option is set, "--tls-cert" is also required. (Arg-Required)

    --tls-get-peer-cert [<output-file>]
        Get a copy of the TLS peer's certificate. If no argument is given,
        it will be displayed to "STDOUT". If an argument is given it is
        assumed to be a filesystem path specifying where the certificate
        should be written. The saved certificate can then be examined using
        standard tools such as the openssl command. If a file is specified
        its contents will be overwritten. (Arg-Optional)

    --tls-sni <sni-string>
        Specify the Server Name Indication field to send when the TLS
        connection is initiated. (Arg-Required)

AUTHENTICATION
    Swaks will attempt to authenticate to the target mail server if
    instructed to do so. This section details available authentication
    types, requirements, options and their interactions, and other fine
    points in authentication usage. Because authentication is defined as an
    extension in the ESMTP protocol it will be unavailable if "--protocol"
    is set to a variation of SMTP.

    All authentication methods require base64 encoding. If the MIME::Base64
    Perl module is loadable Swaks attempts to use it to perform these
    encodings. If MIME::Base64 is not available Swaks will use its own
    onboard base64 routines. These are slower than the MIME::Base64 routines
    and less reviewed, though they have been tested thoroughly. Using the
    MIME::Base64 module is encouraged.

    If authentication is required (see options below for when it is and
    isn't required) and the requirements aren't met for the authentication
    type available, Swaks displays an error and exits. Two ways this can
    happen include forcing Swaks to use a specific authentication type that
    Swaks can't use due to missing requirements, or allowing Swaks to use
    any authentication type, but the server only advertises types Swaks
    can't support. In the former case Swaks errors out at option processing
    time since it knows up front it won't be able to authenticate. In the
    latter case Swaks will error out at the authentication stage of the SMTP
    transaction since Swaks will not be aware that it will not be able to
    authenticate until that point.

    Following are the supported authentication types including any
    individual notes and requirements.

    The following options affect Swaks' use of authentication. These options
    are all inter-related. For instance, specifying "--auth-user" implies
    "--auth" and "--auth-password". Specifying "--auth-optional" implies
    "--auth-user" and "--auth-password", etc.

    -a, --auth [<auth-type>[,<auth-type>[,...]]]
        Require Swaks to authenticate. If no argument is given, any
        supported auth-types advertised by the server are tried until one
        succeeds or all fail. If one or more auth-types are specified as an
        argument, each that the server also supports is tried in order until
        one succeeds or all fail. This option requires Swaks to
        authenticate, so if no common auth-types are found or no credentials
        succeed, Swaks displays an error and exits. (Arg-Optional)

        The following tables lists the valid auth-types

        LOGIN, PLAIN
            These basic authentication types are fully supported and tested
            and have no additional requirements

        CRAM-MD5
            The CRAM-MD5 authenticator requires the Digest::MD5 module. It
            is fully tested and believed to work against any server that
            implements it.

        DIGEST-MD5
            The DIGEST-MD5 authenticator (RFC2831) requires the Authen::SASL
            module. Version 20100211.0 and earlier used Authen::DigestMD5
            which had some protocol level errors which prevented it from
            working with some servers. Authen::SASL's DIGEST-MD5 handling is
            much more robust.

            The DIGEST-MD5 implementation in Swaks is fairly immature. It
            currently supports only the "auth" qop type, for instance. If
            you have DIGEST-MD5 experience and would like to help Swaks
            support DIGEST-MD5 better, please get in touch with me.

            The DIGEST-MD5 protocol's "realm" value can be set using the
            "--auth-extra" "realm" keyword. If no realm is given, a
            reasonable default will be used.

            The DIGEST-MD5 protocol's "digest-uri" values can be set using
            the "--auth-extra" option. For instance, you could create the
            digest-uri-value of "lmtp/mail.example.com/example.com" with the
            option "--auth-extra
            dmd5-serv-type=lmtp,dmd5-host=mail.example.com,dmd5-serv-name=ex
            ample.com". The "digest-uri-value" string and its components is
            defined in RFC2831. If none of these values are given,
            reasonable defaults will be used.

        CRAM-SHA1
            The CRAM-SHA1 authenticator requires the Digest::SHA module.
            This type has only been tested against a non-standard
            implementation on an Exim server and may therefore have some
            implementation deficiencies.

        NTLM/SPA/MSN
            These authenticators require the Authen::NTLM module. Note that
            there are two modules using the Authen::NTLM namespace on CPAN.
            The Mark Bush implementation (Authen/NTLM-1.03.tar.gz) is the
            version required by Swaks. This type has been tested against
            Exim, Communigate, and Exchange 2007.

            In addition to the standard username and password, this
            authentication type can also recognize a "domain". The domain
            can be set using the "--auth-extra" "domain" keyword. Note that
            this has never been tested with a mail server that doesn't
            ignore DOMAIN so this may be implemented incorrectly.

    -ao, --auth-optional [<auth-type>[,<auth-type>[,...]]]
        This option behaves identically to "--auth" except that it requests
        authentication rather than requiring it. If no common auth-types are
        found or no credentials succeed, Swaks proceeds as if authentication
        had not been requested. (Arg-Optional)

    -aos, --auth-optional-strict [<auth-type>[,<auth-type>[,...]]]
        This option is a compromise between "--auth" and "--auth-optional".
        If no common auth-types are found, Swaks behaves as if
        "--auth-optional" were specified and proceeds with the transaction.
        If Swaks can't support requested auth-type, the server doesn't
        advertise any common auth-types, or if no credentials succeed, Swaks
        behaves as if "--auth" were used and exits with an error.
        (Arg-Optional)

    -au, --auth-user [<username>]
        Provide the username to be used for authentication. If no username
        is provided, indicate that Swaks should attempt to find the username
        via .netrc (requires the Net::Netrc module). If no username is
        provided and cannot be found via .netrc, the user will be prompted
        to provide one. The string "<>" can be supplied to mean an empty
        username. (Arg-Required, From-Prompt)

    -ap, --auth-password [<password>]
        Provide the password to be used for authentication. If no password
        is provided, indicate that Swaks should attempt to find the password
        via .netrc (requires the Net::Netrc module). If no password is
        provided and cannot be found via .netrc, the user will be prompted
        to provide one. The string "<>" can be supplied to mean an empty
        password. (Arg-Required, From-Prompt, Sensitive)

    -ae, --auth-extra <key-value-pair>[,<key-value-pair>[,...]]
        Some of the authentication types allow extra information to be
        included in the authentication process. Rather than add a new option
        for every nook and cranny of each authenticator, the "--auth-extra"
        option allows this information to be supplied. The format for
        <key-value-pair> is KEYWORD=VALUE. (Arg-Required)

        The following table lists the currently recognized keywords and the
        authenticators that use them

        realm, domain
            The realm and domain keywords are synonymous. Using either will
            set the "domain" option in NTLM/MSN/SPA and the "realm" option
            in DIGEST-MD5

        dmd5-serv-type
            The dmd5-serv-type keyword is used by the DIGEST-MD5
            authenticator and is used, in part, to build the
            digest-uri-value string (see RFC2831)

        dmd5-host
            The dmd5-host keyword is used by the DIGEST-MD5 authenticator
            and is used, in part, to build the digest-uri-value string (see
            RFC2831)

        dmd5-serv-name
            The dmd5-serv-name keyword is used by the DIGEST-MD5
            authenticator and is used, in part, to build the
            digest-uri-value string (see RFC2831)

    -am, --auth-map <key-value-pair>[,<key-value-pair>[,...]]
        Provides a way to map alternate names onto base authentication
        types. Useful for any sites that use alternate names for common
        types. The format for <key-value-pair> is AUTH-ALIAS=AUTH-TYPE. This
        functionality is actually used internally to map types SPA and MSN
        onto the base type NTLM. The command line argument to simulate this
        would be "--auth-map SPA=NTLM,MSN=NTLM". All of the auth-types
        listed above are valid targets for mapping except SPA and MSN.
        (Arg-Required)

    -apt, --auth-plaintext
        Instead of showing AUTH strings base64 encoded as they are
        transmitted, translate them to plaintext before printing on screen.
        (Arg-None)

    -ahp, --auth-hide-password [<replacement-string>]
        If this option is specified, any time a readable password would be
        printed to the terminal (specifically AUTH PLAIN and AUTH LOGIN) the
        password is replaced with the string 'PROVIDED_BUT_REMOVED' (or the
        contents of <replacement-string> if provided). The dummy string may
        or may not be base64 encoded, contingent on the "--auth-plaintext"
        option.

        Note that "--auth-hide-password" is similar, but not identical, to
        the "--protect-prompt" option. The former protects passwords from
        being displayed in the SMTP transaction regardless of how they are
        entered. The latter protects sensitive strings when the user types
        them at the terminal, regardless of how the string would be used.
        (Arg-Optional)

XCLIENT OPTIONS
    XCLIENT is an SMTP extension introduced by the Postfix project. XCLIENT
    allows a (properly-authorized) client to tell a server to use alternate
    information, such as IP address or hostname, for the client. This allows
    much easier paths for testing mail server configurations. Full details
    on the protocol are available at
    <http://www.postfix.org/XCLIENT_README.html>.

    The XCLIENT verb can be passed to the server multiple times per SMTP
    session with different attributes. For instance, HELO and PROTO might be
    passed in one call and NAME and ADDR passed in a second. Because it can
    be useful for testing, Swaks exposes some control over how the
    attributes are grouped and in what order they are passed to the server.
    The different options attempt to expose simplicity for those using Swaks
    as a client, and complexity for those using Swaks to test installs.

    --xclient-addr [<string>]
    --xclient-name [<string>]
    --xclient-port [<string>]
    --xclient-proto [<string>]
    --xclient-destaddr [<string>]
    --xclient-destport [<string>]
    --xclient-helo [<string>]
    --xclient-login [<string>]
    --xclient-reverse-name [<string>]
        These options specify XCLIENT attributes that should be sent to the
        target server. If <string> is not provided, Swaks will prompt and
        read the value on "STDIN". See
        <http://www.postfix.org/XCLIENT_README.html> for official
        documentation for what the attributes mean and their possible
        values, including the special "[UNAVAILABLE]" and "[TEMPUNAVAIL]"
        values.

        By way of simple example, setting "--xclient-name foo.example.com
        --xclient-addr 192.168.1.1" will cause Swaks to send the SMTP
        command "XCLIENT NAME=foo.example.com ADDR=192.168.1.1".

        Note that the "REVERSE_NAME" attribute doesn't seem to appear in the
        official documentation. There is a mailing list thread that
        documents it, viewable at
        <http://comments.gmane.org/gmane.mail.postfix.user/192623>.

        These options can all be mixed with each other, and can be mixed
        with the "--xclient" option (see below). By default all attributes
        will be combined into one XCLIENT call, but see "--xclient-delim".
        (Arg-Required, From-Prompt)

    --xclient-delim
        When this option is specified, it indicates a break in XCLIENT
        attributes to be sent. For instance, setting "--xclient-helo 'helo
        string' --xclient-delim --xclient-name foo.example.com
        --xclient-addr 192.168.1.1" will cause Swaks to send two XCLIENT
        calls, "XCLIENT HELO=helo+20string" and "XCLIENT
        NAME=foo.example.com ADDR=192.168.1.1". This option is ignored where
        it doesn't make sense (at the start or end of XCLIENT options, by
        itself, consecutively, etc). (Arg-None)

    --xclient [<string>]
        This is the "free form" XCLIENT option. Whatever value is provided
        for <string> will be sent verbatim as the argument to the XCLIENT
        SMTP command. For example, if "--xclient 'NAME= ADDR=192.168.1.1
        FOO=bar'" is used, Swaks will send the SMTP command "XCLIENT NAME=
        ADDR=192.168.1.1 FOO=bar". If no argument is passed on command line,
        Swaks will prompt and read the value on STDIN.

        The primary advantage to this over the more specific options above
        is that there is no XCLIENT syntax validation here. This allows you
        to send invalid XCLIENT to the target server for testing.
        Additionally, at least one MTA (Message Systems' Momentum, formerly
        ecelerity) implements XCLIENT without advertising supported
        attributes. The "--xclient" option allows you to skip the "supported
        attributes" check when communicating with this type of MTA (though
        see also "--xclient-no-verify").

        The "--xclient" option can be mixed freely with the "--xclient-*"
        options above. The argument to "--xclient" will be sent in its own
        command group. For instance, if "--xclient-addr 192.168.0.1
        --xclient-port 26 --xclient 'FOO=bar NAME=wind'" is given to Swaks,
        "XCLIENT ADDR=192.168.0.1 PORT=26" and "XCLIENT FOO=bar NAME=wind"
        will both be sent to the target server. (Arg-Required, From-Prompt)

    --xclient-no-verify
        Do not enforce the requirement that an XCLIENT attribute must be
        advertised by the server in order for Swaks to send it in an XCLIENT
        command. This is to support servers which don't advertise the
        attributes but still support them. (Arg-None)

    --xclient-before-starttls
        If Swaks is configured to attempt both XCLIENT and STARTTLS, it will
        do STARTTLS first. If this option is specified it will attempt
        XCLIENT first. (Arg-None)

    --xclient-optional
    --xclient-optional-strict
        In normal operation, setting one of the "--xclient*" options will
        require a successful XCLIENT transaction to take place in order to
        proceed (that is, XCLIENT needs to be advertised, all the
        user-requested attributes need to have been advertised, and the
        server needs to have accepted Swaks' XCLIENT request). These options
        change that behavior. "--xclient-optional" tells Swaks to proceed
        unconditionally past the XCLIENT stage of the SMTP transaction,
        regardless of whether it was successful. "--xclient-optional-strict"
        is similar but more granular. The strict version will continue to
        XCLIENT was not advertised, but will fail if XCLIENT was attempted
        but did not succeed. (Arg-None)

PROXY OPTIONS
    Swaks implements the Proxy protocol as defined in
    <http://www.haproxy.org/download/1.5/doc/proxy-protocol.txt>. Proxy
    allows an application load balancer, such as HAProxy, to be used in
    front of an MTA while still allowing the MTA access to the originating
    host information. Proxy support in Swaks allows direct testing of an MTA
    configured to expect requests from a proxy, bypassing the proxy itself
    during testing.

    Swaks makes no effort to ensure that the Proxy options used are
    internally consistent. For instance, "--proxy-family" (in version 1) is
    expected to be one of "TCP4" or "TCP6". While it will likely not make
    sense to the target server, Swaks makes no attempt to ensure that
    "--proxy-source" and "--proxy-dest" are in the same protocol family as
    "--proxy-family" or each other.

    The "--proxy" option is mutually exclusive with all other "--proxy-*"
    options except "--proxy-version".

    When "--proxy" is not used, all of "--proxy-family", "--proxy-source",
    "--proxy-source-port", "--proxy-dest", and "--proxy-dest-port" are
    required. Additionally, when "--proxy-version" is 2, "--proxy-protocol"
    and "--proxy-command" are optional.

    --proxy-version [ 1 | 2 ]
        Whether to use version 1 (human readable) or version 2 (binary) of
        the Proxy protocol. Version 1 is the default. Version 2 is only
        implemented through the "address block", and is roughly on par with
        the information provided in version 1.

    --proxy [<string>]
        If this option is used, its argument is passed unchanged after the
        "PROXY " portion (or the 12-byte protocol header for version 2) of
        the Proxy exchange. This option allows sending incomplete or
        malformed Proxy strings to a target server for testing. No attempt
        to translate or modify this string is made, so if used with
        "--proxy-version 2" the argument should be in the appropriate binary
        format. This option is mutually exclusive with all other "--proxy-*"
        options which provide granular proxy information. (Arg-Required,
        From-Prompt)

    --proxy-family [<string>]
        For version 1, specifies both the address family and transport
        protocol. The protocol defines TCP4 and TCP6.

        For version 2, specifies only the address family. The protocol
        defines AF_UNSPEC, AF_INET, AF_INET6, and AF_UNIX. (Arg-Required,
        From-Prompt)

    --proxy-protocol [<string>]
        For version 2, specifies the transport protocol. The protocol
        defines UNSPEC, STREAM, and DGRAM. The default is STREAM. This
        option is unused in version 1. (Arg-Required, From-Prompt)

    --proxy-command [<string>]
        For version 2, specifies the transport protocol. The protocol
        defines LOCAL and PROXY. The default is PROXY. This option is unused
        in version 1. (Arg-Required, From-Prompt)

    --proxy-source [<string>]
        Specify the source address of the proxied connection. (Arg-Required,
        From-Prompt)

    --proxy-source-port [<string>]
        Specify the source port of the proxied connection. (Arg-Required,
        From-Prompt)

    --proxy-dest [<string>]
        Specify the destination address of the proxied connection.
        (Arg-Required, From-Prompt)

    --proxy-dest-port [<string>]
        Specify the destination port of the proxied connection.
        (Arg-Required, From-Prompt)

DATA OPTIONS
    These options pertain to the contents for the DATA portion of the SMTP
    transaction. By default a very simple message is sent. If the "--attach"
    or "--attach-body" options are used, Swaks attempts to upgrade to a MIME
    message.

    -d, --data [<data-portion>]
        Use argument as the entire contents of DATA.

        If no argument is provided, user will be prompted to supply value.

        If the argument "-" is provided the data will be read from "STDIN"
        with no prompt.

        If the argument starts with "@" it will be treated as a filename. If
        you would like to pass in an argument that starts with "@" and isn't
        a filename, prefix the argument with an additional "@". For example,
        "@file.txt" will force processing of file.txt. @@data will use the
        string '@data'.

        If the argument does not contain any literal (0x0a) or
        representative (0x5c, 0x6e or %NEWLINE%) newline characters, it will
        be treated as a filename. If the file is open-able, the contents of
        the file will be used as the data portion. If the file cannot be
        opened, Swaks will error and exit. The entire behavior described in
        this paragraph is deprecated and will be removed in a future
        release. Instead use a leading "@" to explicitly set that the
        argument is a filename.

        Any other argument will be used as the DATA contents.

        The value can be on one single line, with "\n" (ASCII 0x5c, 0x6e)
        representing where line breaks should be placed. Leading dots will
        be quoted. Closing dot is not required but is allowed. The default
        value for this option is "Date: %DATE%\nTo: %TO_ADDRESS%\nFrom:
        %FROM_ADDRESS%\nSubject: test %DATE%\nMessage-Id:
        <%MESSAGEID%"\nX-Mailer: swaks v%SWAKS_VERSION%
        jetmore.org/john/code/swaks/\n%NEW_HEADERS%\n%BODY%\n>.

        Very basic token parsing is performed on the DATA portion. The
        following table shows the recognized tokens and their replacement
        values. (Arg-Required, From-Prompt, From-File)

        %FROM_ADDRESS%
            Replaced with the envelope-sender.

        %TO_ADDRESS%
            Replaced with the envelope-recipient(s).

        %DATE%
            Replaced with the current time in a format suitable for
            inclusion in the Date: header. Note this attempts to use the
            standard module POSIX for timezone calculations. If this module
            is unavailable the date string will be in GMT.

        %MESSAGEID%
            Replaced with a message ID string suitable for use in a
            Message-Id header. The value for this token will remain
            consistent for the life of the process.

        %SWAKS_VERSION%
            Replaced with the version of the currently-running Swaks
            process.

        %NEW_HEADERS%
            Replaced with the contents of the "--add-header" option. If
            "--add-header" is not specified this token is simply removed.

        %BODY%
            Replaced with the value specified by the "--body" option. See
            "--body" for default.

        %NEWLINE%
            Replaced with carriage return, newline (0x0d, 0x0a). This is
            identical to using "\n" (0x5c, 0x6e), but doesn't have the
            escaping concerns that the backslash can cause on the newline.

    -dab, --dump-as-body [<section>[,<section>[,...]]]
        If "--dump-as-body" is used and no other option is used to change
        the default body of the message, the body is replaced with output
        similar to the output of what is provided by "--dump". "--dump"'s
        initial program capability stanza is not displayed, and the "data"
        section is not included. Additionally, "--dump" always includes
        passwords. By default "--dump-as-body" does not include passwords,
        though this can be changed with "--dump-as-body-shows-password".
        "--dump-as-body" takes the same arguments as "--dump" except the
        SUPPORT and DATA arguments are not supported. (Arg-Optional)

    -dabsp, --dump-as-body-shows-password
        Cause "--dump-as-body" to include plaintext passwords. This option
        is not recommended. This option implies "--dump-as-body". (Arg-None)

    --body [<body-specification>]
        Specify the body of the email. The default is "This is a test
        mailing". If no argument to "--body" is given, prompt to supply one
        interactively. If "-" is supplied, the body will be read from
        standard input. Arguments beginning with "@" will be treated as
        filenames containing the body data to use (see "--data" for more
        detail).

        If, after the above processing, the argument represents an open-able
        file, the content of that file is used as the body. This is
        deprecated behavior and will be removed in a future release. Instead
        use a leading "@" to explicitly set that the argument is a filename.

        If the message is forced to MIME format (see "--attach") "--body
        'body text'" is the same as "--attach-type text/plain --attach-body
        'body text'". See "--attach-body" for details on creating a
        multipart/alternative body. (Arg-Required, From-Prompt, From-File)

    --attach [<attachment-specification>]
        When one or more "--attach" option is supplied, the message is
        changed into a multipart/mixed MIME message. The arguments to
        "--attach" are processed the same as "--body" with respect to
        "STDIN", file contents, etc. "--attach" can be supplied multiple
        times to create multiple attachments. By default, each attachment is
        attached as an application/octet-stream file. See "--attach-type"
        for changing this behavior.

        If the contents of the attachment are provided via a file name, the
        MIME encoding will include that file name. See "--attach-name" for
        more detail on file naming.

        It is legal for "-" ("STDIN") to be specified as an argument
        multiple times (once for "--body" and multiple times for
        "--attach"). In this case, the same content will be attached each
        time it is specified. This is useful for attaching the same content
        with multiple MIME types. (Arg-Required, From-File)

    --attach-body [<body-specification>]
        This is a variation on "--attach" that is specifically for the body
        part of the email. It behaves identically to "--attach" in that it
        takes the same arguments and forces the creation of a MIME message.
        However, it is different in that the argument will always be the
        first MIME part in the message, no matter where in option processing
        order it is encountered. Additionally, "--attach-body" options stack
        to allow creation of multipart/alternative bodies. For example,
        "--attach-type text/plain --attach-body 'plain text body'
        --attach-type text/html --attach-body 'html body'" would create a
        multipart/alternative message body. (Arg-Required, From-File)

    --attach-type <mime-type>
        By default, content that gets MIME attached to a message with the
        "--attach" option is encoded as application/octet-stream (except for
        the body, which is text/plain by default). "--attach-type" changes
        the mime type for every "--attach" option which follows it. It can
        be specified multiple times. The current MIME type gets reset to
        application/octet-stream between processing body parts and other
        parts. (Arg-Required)

    --attach-name [<name>]
        This option sets the filename that will be included in the MIME part
        created for the next "--attach" option. If no argument is set for
        this option, it causes no filename information to be included for
        the next MIME part, even if Swaks could generate it from the local
        file name. (Arg-Optional)

    -ah, --add-header <header>
        This option allows headers to be added to the DATA. If
        "%NEW_HEADERS%" is present in the DATA it is replaced with the
        argument to this option. If "%NEW_HEADERS%" is not present, the
        argument is inserted between the first two consecutive newlines in
        the DATA (that is, it is inserted at the end of the existing
        headers).

        The option can either be specified multiple times or a single time
        with multiple headers separated by a literal "\n" string. So,
        "--add-header 'Foo: bar' --add-header 'Baz: foo'" and "--add-header
        'Foo: bar\nBaz: foo'" end up adding the same two headers.
        (Arg-Required)

    --header <header-and-data>, --h-<header> <data>
        These options allow a way to change headers that already exist in
        the DATA. "--header 'Subject: foo'" and "--h-Subject foo" are
        equivalent. If the header does not already exist in the data then
        this argument behaves identically to "--add-header". However, if the
        header already exists it is replaced with the one specified.
        Negating the version of this option with the header name in the
        option (eg "--no-header-Subject") will remove all previously
        processed "--header" options, not just the ones used for 'Subject'.
        (Arg-Required)

    -g  This option is a direct alias to "--data -" (read DATA from
        "STDIN"). It is totally secondary to "--data". Any occurrence of
        "--data" will cause "-g" to be ignored. This option cannot be
        negated with the "no-" prefix. This option is deprecated and will be
        removed in a future version of Swaks. (Arg-None, Deprecated)

    --no-data-fixup, -ndf
        This option forces Swaks to do no massaging of the DATA portion of
        the email. This includes token replacement, From_ stripping,
        trailing-dot addition, "--body"/attachment inclusion, and any header
        additions. This option is only useful when used with "--data", since
        the internal default DATA portion uses tokens. (Arg-None)

    --no-strip-from, -nsf
        Don't strip the From_ line from the DATA portion, if present.
        (Arg-None)

OUTPUT OPTIONS
    Swaks provides a transcript of its transactions to its caller
    ("STDOUT"/"STDERR") by default. This transcript aims to be as faithful a
    representation as possible of the transaction though it does modify this
    output by adding informational prefixes to lines and by providing
    plaintext versions of TLS transactions

    The "informational prefixes" are referred to as transaction hints. These
    hints are initially composed of those marking lines that are output of
    Swaks itself, either informational or error messages, and those that
    indicate a line of data actually sent or received in a transaction. This
    table indicates the hints and their meanings:

    "==="
        Indicates an informational line generated by Swaks.

    "***"
        Indicates an error generated within Swaks.

    " ->"
        Indicates an expected line sent by Swaks to target server.

    " ~>"
        Indicates a TLS-encrypted, expected line sent by Swaks to target
        server.

    "**>"
        Indicates an unexpected line sent by Swaks to the target server.

    "*~>"
        Indicates a TLS-encrypted, unexpected line sent by Swaks to target
        server.

    "  >"
        Indicates a raw chunk of text sent by Swaks to a target server (see
        "--show-raw-text"). There is no concept of "expected" or
        "unexpected" at this level.

    "<- "
        Indicates an expected line sent by target server to Swaks.

    "<~ "
        Indicates a TLS-encrypted, expected line sent by target server to
        Swaks.

    "<**"
        Indicates an unexpected line sent by target server to Swaks.

    "<~*"
        Indicates a TLS-encrypted, unexpected line sent by target server to
        Swaks.

    "<  "
        Indicates a raw chunk of text received by Swaks from a target server
        (see "--show-raw-text"). There is no concept of "expected" or
        "unexpected" at this level.

    The following options control what and how output is displayed to the
    caller.

    -n, --suppress-data
        Summarizes the DATA portion of the SMTP transaction instead of
        printing every line. This option is very helpful, bordering on
        required, when using Swaks to send certain test emails. Emails with
        attachments, for instance, will quickly overwhelm a terminal if the
        DATA is not suppressed. (Arg-None)

    -stl, --show-time-lapse [i]
        Display time lapse between send/receive pairs. This option is most
        useful when Time::HiRes is available, in which case the time lapse
        will be displayed in thousandths of a second. If Time::HiRes is
        unavailable or "i" is given as an argument the lapse will be
        displayed in integer seconds only. (Arg-Optional)

    -nih, --no-info-hints
        Don't display the transaction hint for informational transactions.
        This is most useful when needing to copy some portion of the
        informational lines, for instance the certificate output from
        "--tls-get-peer-cert". (Arg-None)

    -nsh, --no-send-hints
    -nrh, --no-receive-hints
    -nth, --no-hints
        "--no-send-hints" and "--no-receive-hints" suppress the transaction
        hints from send and receive lines, respectively. This is often
        useful when copying some portion of the transaction for use
        elsewhere (for instance, "--no-send-hints --hide-receive
        --hide-informational" is a useful way to get only the client-side
        commands for a given transaction). "--no-hints" is identical to
        specifying both "--no-send-hints" and "--no-receive-hints".
        (Arg-None)

    -raw, --show-raw-text
        This option will print a hex dump of raw data sent and received by
        Swaks. Each hex dump is the contents of a single read or write on
        the network. This should be identical to what is already being
        displayed (with the exception of the "\r" characters being removed).
        This option is useful in seeing details when servers are sending
        lots of data in single packets, or breaking up individual lines into
        multiple packets. If you really need to go in depth in that area
        you're probably better with a packet sniffer, but this option is a
        good first step to seeing odd connection issues. (Arg-None)

    --output, --output-file <file-path>
    --output-file-stdout <file-path>
    --output-file-stderr <file-path>
        These options allow the user to send output to files instead of
        "STDOUT"/"STDERR". The first option sends both to the same file. The
        arguments of &STDOUT and &STDERR are treated specially, referring to
        the "normal" file handles, so "--output-file-stderr '&STDOUT'" would
        redirect "STDERR" to "STDOUT". These options are honored for all
        output except "--help" and "--version". (Arg-Required)

    -pp, --protect-prompt
        Don't echo user input on prompts that are potentially sensitive
        (right now only authentication password). Very specifically, any
        option which is marked 'Sensitive' and eventually prompts for an
        argument will do its best to mask that argument from being echoed.
        See also "--auth-hide-password". (Arg-None)

    -hr, --hide-receive
        Don't display lines sent from the remote server being received by
        Swaks. (Arg-None)

    -hs, --hide-send
        Don't display lines being sent by Swaks to the remote server.
        (Arg-None)

    -hi, --hide-informational
        Don't display non-error informational lines from Swaks itself.
        (Arg-None)

    -ha, --hide-all
        Do not display any content to the terminal. (Arg-None)

    -S, --silent [ 1 | 2 | 3 ]
        Cause Swaks to be silent. If no argument is given or if an argument
        of "1" is given, print no output unless/until an error occurs, after
        which all output is shown. If an argument of "2" is given, only
        print errors. If "3" is given, show no output ever. "--silent"
        affects most output but not all. For instance, "--help",
        "--version", "--dump", and "--dump-mail" are not affected.
        (Arg-Optional)

    --support
        Print capabilities and exit. Certain features require non-standard
        Perl modules. This option evaluates whether these modules are
        present and displays which functionality is available and which
        isn't, and which modules would need to be added to gain the missing
        functionality. (Arg-None)

    --dump-mail
        Cause Swaks to process all options to generate the message it would
        send, then print that message to "STDOUT" instead of sending it.
        This output is identical to the "data" section of "--dump", except
        without the trailing dot. (Arg-None)

    --dump [<section>[,<section>[,...]]]
        This option causes Swaks to print the results of option processing,
        immediately before mail would have been sent. No mail will be sent
        when "--dump" is used. Note that "--dump" is a pure self-diagnosis
        tool and no effort is made or will ever be made to mask passwords in
        the "--dump" output. If a section is provided as an argument to this
        option, only the requested section will be shown. Currently
        supported arguments are SUPPORT, APP, OUTPUT, TRANSPORT, PROTOCOL,
        XCLIENT, PROXY, TLS, AUTH, DATA, and ALL. If no argument is
        provided, all sections are displayed (Arg-Optional)

    --help
        Display this help information and exit. (Arg-None)

    --version
        Display version information and exit. (Arg-None)

DEPRECATIONS
    The following features are deprecated and will be removed in a future
    version of Swaks

    -g option
        Will be removed no sooner than November 1, 2021.

        The -g option is currently a less-good alias to "--data -". Any uses
        of "-g" should be able to be directly migrated to "--data -"
        instead.

    auto-filename detection
        Will be removed no sooner than November 1, 2021.

        The "--data", "--body", "--attach", and "--attach-body" options
        currently will attempt to distinguish between an argument that is
        the actual value to use vs. an argument that represents a file
        containing the data to use. This behavior has been superseded by
        prefixing an argument to these options with "@" to explicitly
        indicate that the argument indicates a file. Any uses of providing a
        filename to one of these options should be moved to using "@" to
        indicate a filename is being used.

PORTABILITY
    OPERATING SYSTEMS
        This program was primarily intended for use on UNIX-like operating
        systems, and it should work on any reasonable version thereof. It
        has been developed and tested on Solaris, Linux, and Mac OS X and is
        feature complete on all of these.

        This program is known to demonstrate basic functionality on Windows
        using ActiveState's Perl. It has not been fully tested. Known to
        work are basic SMTP functionality and the LOGIN, PLAIN, and CRAM-MD5
        auth types. Unknown is any TLS functionality and the NTLM/SPA and
        DIGEST-MD5 auth types.

        Because this program should work anywhere Perl works, I would
        appreciate knowing about any new operating systems you've thoroughly
        used Swaks on as well as any problems encountered on a new OS.

    MAIL SERVERS
        This program was almost exclusively developed against Exim mail
        servers. It has been used casually by the author, though not
        thoroughly tested, with Sendmail, Smail, Exchange, Oracle
        Collaboration Suite, qpsmtpd, and Communigate. Because all
        functionality in Swaks is based on known standards it should work
        with any fairly modern mail server. If a problem is found, please
        alert the author at the address below.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
    LOGNAME
        If Swaks must create a sender address, $LOGNAME is used as the
        message local-part if it is set, and unless "--force-getpwuid" is
        used.

    SWAKS_HOME
        Used when searching for a .swaksrc configuration file. See OPTION
        PROCESSING -> "CONFIGURATION FILES" above.

    SWAKS_OPT_*
        Environment variable prefix used to specify Swaks options from
        environment variables. See OPTION PROCESSING -> "CONFIGURATION
        ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES" above.

EXIT CODES
    0   no errors occurred

    1   error parsing command line options

    2   error connecting to remote server

    3   unknown connection type

    4   while running with connection type of "pipe", fatal problem writing
        to or reading from the child process

    5   while running with connection type of "pipe", child process died
        unexpectedly. This can mean that the program specified with "--pipe"
        doesn't exist.

    6   Connection closed unexpectedly. If the close is detected in response
        to the 'QUIT' Swaks sends following an unexpected response, the
        error code for that unexpected response is used instead. For
        instance, if a mail server returns a 550 response to a MAIL FROM:
        and then immediately closes the connection, Swaks detects that the
        connection is closed, but uses the more specific exit code 23 to
        detail the nature of the failure. If instead the server return a 250
        code and then immediately closes the connection, Swaks will use the
        exit code 6 because there is not a more specific exit code.

    10  error in prerequisites (needed module not available)

    21  error reading initial banner from server

    22  error in HELO transaction

    23  error in MAIL transaction

    24  no RCPTs accepted

    25  server returned error to DATA request

    26  server did not accept mail following data

    27  server returned error after normal-session quit request

    28  error in AUTH transaction

    29  error in TLS transaction

    30  PRDR requested/required but not advertised

    32  error in EHLO following TLS negotiation

    33  error in XCLIENT transaction

    34  error in EHLO following XCLIENT

    35  error in PROXY option processing

    36  error sending PROXY banner

ABOUT THE NAME
    The name "Swaks" is a (sort-of) acronym for "SWiss Army Knife SMTP". It
    was chosen to be fairly distinct and pronounceable. While "Swaks" is
    unique as the name of a software package, it has some other,
    non-software meanings. Please send in other uses of "swak" or "swaks"
    for inclusion.

    "Sealed With A Kiss"
        SWAK/SWAKs turns up occasionally on the internet with the meaning
        "with love".

    bad / poor / ill (Afrikaans)
        Seen in the headline "SA se bes en swaks gekledes in 2011", which
        was translated as "best and worst dressed" by native speakers.
        Google Translate doesn't like "swaks gekledes", but it will
        translate "swak" as "poor" and "swak geklede" as "ill-dressed".
