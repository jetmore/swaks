# The next three settings create two lists of domains and one list of hosts.
# These lists are referred to later in this configuration using the syntax
# +local_domains, +relay_to_domains, and +relay_from_hosts, respectively. They
# are all colon-separated lists:

domainlist local_domains = @
domainlist relay_to_domains =
hostlist   relay_from_hosts = localhost
# (We rely upon hostname resolution working for localhost, because the default
# uncommented configuration needs to work in IPv4-only environments.)

# Most straightforward access control requirements can be obtained by
# appropriate settings of the above options. In more complicated situations,
# you may need to modify the Access Control Lists (ACLs) which appear later in
# this file.

# The first setting specifies your local domains, for example:
#
#   domainlist local_domains = my.first.domain : my.second.domain
#
# You can use "@" to mean "the name of the local host", as in the default
# setting above. This is the name that is specified by primary_hostname,
# as specified above (or defaulted). If you do not want to do any local
# deliveries, remove the "@" from the setting above. If you want to accept mail
# addressed to your host's literal IP address, for example, mail addressed to
# "user@[192.168.23.44]", you can add "@[]" as an item in the local domains
# list. You also need to uncomment "allow_domain_literals" below. This is not
# recommended for today's Internet.

# The second setting specifies domains for which your host is an incoming relay.
# If you are not doing any relaying, you should leave the list empty. However,
# if your host is an MX backup or gateway of some kind for some domains, you
# must set relay_to_domains to match those domains. For example:
#
# domainlist relay_to_domains = *.myco.com : my.friend.org
#
# This will allow any host to relay through your host to those domains.
# See the section of the manual entitled "Control of relaying" for more
# information.

# The third setting specifies hosts that can use your host as an outgoing relay
# to any other host on the Internet. Such a setting commonly refers to a
# complete local network as well as the localhost. For example:
#
# hostlist relay_from_hosts = <; 127.0.0.1 ; ::1 ; 192.168.0.0/16
#
# The "/16" is a bit mask (CIDR notation), not a number of hosts. Note that you
# have to include 127.0.0.1 if you want to allow processes on your host to send
# SMTP mail by using the loopback address. A number of MUAs use this method of
# sending mail.  Often, connections are made to "localhost", which might be ::1
# on IPv6-enabled hosts.  Do not forget CIDR for your IPv6 networks.

# All three of these lists may contain many different kinds of item, including
# wildcarded names, regular expressions, and file lookups. See the reference
# manual for details. The lists above are used in the access control lists for
# checking incoming messages. The names of these ACLs are defined here:

# If you are running a version of Exim that was compiled with the content-

# of what to set for other virus scanners. The second modification is in the
# acl_check_data access control list (see below).

# For spam scanning, there is a similar option that defines the interface to

# users that it specifies is built into the binary, and cannot be changed. The

  #############################################################################
  # The following section of the ACL is concerned with local parts that contain
  # @ or % or ! or / or | or dots in unusual places.
  #
  # The characters other than dots are rarely found in genuine local parts, but
  # are often tried by people looking to circumvent relaying restrictions.
  # Therefore, although they are valid in local parts, these rules lock them
  # out, as a precaution.
  #
  # Empty components (two dots in a row) are not valid in RFC 2822, but Exim
  # allows them because they have been encountered. (Consider local parts
  # constructed as "firstinitial.secondinitial.familyname" when applied to
  # someone like me, who has no second initial.) However, a local part starting
  # with a dot or containing /../ can cause trouble if it is used as part of a
  # file name (e.g. for a mailing list). This is also true for local parts that
  # contain slashes. A pipe symbol can also be troublesome if the local part is
  # incorporated unthinkingly into a shell command line.
  #
  # Two different rules are used. The first one is stricter, and is applied to
  # messages that are addressed to one of the local domains handled by this
  # host. The line "domains = +local_domains" restricts it to domains that are
  # defined by the "domainlist local_domains" setting above. The rule  blocks
  # local parts that begin with a dot or contain @ % ! / or |. If you have
  # local accounts that include these characters, you will have to modify this

  # The second rule applies to all other domains, and is less strict. The line
  # "domains = !+local_domains" restricts it to domains that are NOT defined by
  # the "domainlist local_domains" setting above. The exclamation mark is a
  # negating operator. This rule allows your own users to send outgoing
  # messages to sites that use slashes and vertical bars in their local parts.
  # It blocks local parts that begin with a dot, slash, or vertical bar, but
  # allows these characters within the local part. However, the sequence /../
  # is barred. The use of @ % and ! is blocked, as before. The motivation here
  # is to prevent your users (or your users' viruses) from mounting certain

# the name gets inserted into this file from whatever is set in Exim's
# build-time configuration. The default path is the traditional /etc/aliases.
# If you install this configuration by hand, you need to specify the correct
# path in the "data" setting below.
#
##### NB  You must ensure that the alias file exists. It used to be the case
##### NB  that every Unix had that file, because it was the Sendmail default.

#
# If any of your aliases expand to pipes or files, you will need to set
# up a user and a group for these deliveries to run under. You can do
# this by uncommenting the "user" option below (changing the user name
# as appropriate) and adding a "group" option if necessary. Alternatively, you
# can specify "user" on the transports that are used. Note that the transports

# The no_verify setting means that this router is skipped when Exim is
# verifying addresses. Similarly, no_expn means that this router is skipped if
# Exim is processing an EXPN command.

# If you want this router to treat local parts with suffixes introduced by "-"
# or "+" characters as if the suffixes did not exist, uncomment the two local_
# part_suffix options. Then, for example, xxxx-foo@your.domain will be treated
# in the same way as xxxx@your.domain by this router. Because this router is

# will *need* to make the same change to the localuser router.  (There are
# other approaches, if this is undesirable, but they add complexity).

# The check_ancestor option means that if the forward file generates an
# address that is an ancestor of the current one, the current one gets
# passed on instead. This covers the case where A is aliased to B and B

######################################################################

# The following authenticators support plaintext username/password
# authentication using the standard PLAIN mechanism and the traditional
# but non-standard LOGIN mechanism, with Exim acting as the server.
# PLAIN and LOGIN are enough to support most MUA software.
#
# These authenticators are not complete: you need to change the
# server_condition settings to specify how passwords are verified.
# They are set up to offer authentication to the client only if the
# connection is encrypted with TLS, so you also need to add support
# for TLS. See the global configuration options section at the start
# of this file for more about TLS.
#
# The default RCPT ACL checks for successful authentication, and will accept
# messages from authenticated users from anywhere on the Internet.

begin authenticators

# PLAIN authentication has no server prompts. The client sends its
# credentials in one lump, containing an authorization ID (which we do not
# use), an authentication ID, and a password. The latter two appear as
# $auth2 and $auth3 in the configuration and should be checked against a
# valid username and password. In a real configuration you would typically
# use $auth2 as a lookup key, and compare $auth3 against the result of the
# lookup, perhaps using the crypteq{}{} condition.

# LOGIN authentication has traditional prompts and responses. There is no
# authorization ID in this mechanism, so unlike PLAIN the username and
