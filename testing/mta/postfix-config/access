# ACCESS(5)                                                            ACCESS(5)
# 
# NAME
#        access - Postfix SMTP server access table
# 
# SYNOPSIS
#        postmap /etc/postfix/access
# 
#        postmap -q "string" /etc/postfix/access
# 
#        postmap -q - /etc/postfix/access <inputfile
# 
# DESCRIPTION
#        This  document  describes  access  control  on remote SMTP
#        client information: host  names,  network  addresses,  and
#        envelope  sender or recipient addresses; it is implemented
#        by the  Postfix  SMTP  server.   See  header_checks(5)  or
#        body_checks(5)  for access control on the content of email
#        messages.
# 
#        Normally, the access(5) table is specified as a text  file
#        that  serves  as  input  to  the  postmap(1) command.  The
#        result, an indexed file in dbm or db format, is  used  for
#        fast  searching  by  the  mail system. Execute the command
#        "postmap /etc/postfix/access" to rebuild an  indexed  file
#        after changing the corresponding text file.
# 
#        When  the  table  is provided via other means such as NIS,
#        LDAP or SQL, the same lookups are  done  as  for  ordinary
#        indexed files.
# 
#        Alternatively,  the  table  can  be  provided  as  a regu-
#        lar-expression map where patterns  are  given  as  regular
#        expressions,  or  lookups  can  be  directed  to TCP-based
#        server. In those cases, the lookups are done in a slightly
#        different way as described below under "REGULAR EXPRESSION
#        TABLES" or "TCP-BASED TABLES".
# 
# CASE FOLDING
#        The search string is folded to lowercase  before  database
#        lookup.  As  of Postfix 2.3, the search string is not case
#        folded with database types such as regexp: or pcre:  whose
#        lookup fields can match both upper and lower case.
# 
# TABLE FORMAT
#        The input format for the postmap(1) command is as follows:
# 
#        pattern action
#               When pattern matches a mail address, domain or host
#               address, perform the corresponding action.
# 
#        blank lines and comments
#               Empty  lines and whitespace-only lines are ignored,
#               as are lines whose first  non-whitespace  character
#               is a `#'.
# 
#        multi-line text
#               A  logical  line starts with non-whitespace text. A
#               line that starts with whitespace continues a  logi-
#               cal line.
# 
# EMAIL ADDRESS PATTERNS
#        With lookups from indexed files such as DB or DBM, or from
#        networked tables such as NIS, LDAP or  SQL,  patterns  are
#        tried in the order as listed below:
# 
#        user@domain
#               Matches the specified mail address.
# 
#        domain.tld
#               Matches  domain.tld  as the domain part of an email
#               address.
# 
#               The pattern domain.tld also matches subdomains, but
#               only when the string smtpd_access_maps is listed in
#               the Postfix  parent_domain_matches_subdomains  con-
#               figuration setting.
# 
#        .domain.tld
#               Matches subdomains of domain.tld, but only when the
#               string smtpd_access_maps is not listed in the Post-
#               fix  parent_domain_matches_subdomains configuration
#               setting.
# 
#        user@  Matches all mail addresses with the specified  user
#               part.
# 
#        Note:  lookup  of  the null sender address is not possible
#        with some types of lookup table. By default, Postfix  uses
#        <>  as  the  lookup  key  for such addresses. The value is
#        specified with the smtpd_null_access_lookup_key  parameter
#        in the Postfix main.cf file.
# 
# EMAIL ADDRESS EXTENSION
#        When a mail address localpart contains the optional recip-
#        ient delimiter (e.g., user+foo@domain), the  lookup  order
#        becomes:  user+foo@domain, user@domain, domain, user+foo@,
#        and user@.
# 
# HOST NAME/ADDRESS PATTERNS
#        With lookups from indexed files such as DB or DBM, or from
#        networked  tables  such as NIS, LDAP or SQL, the following
#        lookup patterns are examined in the order as listed:
# 
#        domain.tld
#               Matches domain.tld.
# 
#               The pattern domain.tld also matches subdomains, but
#               only when the string smtpd_access_maps is listed in
#               the Postfix  parent_domain_matches_subdomains  con-
#               figuration setting.
# 
#        .domain.tld
#               Matches subdomains of domain.tld, but only when the
#               string smtpd_access_maps is not listed in the Post-
#               fix  parent_domain_matches_subdomains configuration
#               setting.
# 
#        net.work.addr.ess
# 
#        net.work.addr
# 
#        net.work
# 
#        net    Matches a  remote  IPv4  host  address  or  network
#               address  range.  Specify one to four decimal octets
#               separated by ".". Do not specify "[]" , "/",  lead-
#               ing zeros, or hexadecimal forms.
# 
#               Network ranges are matched by repeatedly truncating
#               the last ".octet" from a remote IPv4  host  address
#               string, until a match is found in the access table,
#               or until further truncation is not possible.
# 
#               NOTE: use the cidr lookup  table  type  to  specify
#               network/netmask  patterns.  See  cidr_table(5)  for
#               details.
# 
#        net:work:addr:ess
# 
#        net:work:addr
# 
#        net:work
# 
#        net    Matches a  remote  IPv6  host  address  or  network
#               address  range.  Specify three to eight hexadecimal
#               octet pairs separated by ":", using the  compressed
#               form  "::"  for  a  sequence  of  zero-valued octet
#               pairs. Do not specify "[]", "/", leading zeros,  or
#               non-compressed forms.
# 
#               A network range is matched by repeatedly truncating
#               the  last  ":octetpair"  from  the  compressed-form
#               remote  IPv6  host address string, until a match is
#               found in the access table, or until further trunca-
#               tion is not possible.
# 
#               NOTE:  use  the  cidr  lookup table type to specify
#               network/netmask  patterns.  See  cidr_table(5)  for
#               details.
# 
#               IPv6 support is available in Postfix 2.2 and later.
# 
# ACCEPT ACTIONS
#        OK     Accept the address etc. that matches the pattern.
# 
#        all-numerical
#               An all-numerical result is treated as OK. This for-
#               mat  is generated by address-based relay authoriza-
#               tion schemes such as pop-before-smtp.
# 
#        For other accept actions, see "OTHER ACTIONS" below.
# 
# REJECT ACTIONS
#        Postfix version 2.3  and  later  support  enhanced  status
#        codes  as  defined in RFC 3463.  When no code is specified
#        at the beginning of the  text  below,  Postfix  inserts  a
#        default  enhanced  status  code  of "5.7.1" in the case of
#        reject actions, and "4.7.1" in the case of defer  actions.
#        See "ENHANCED STATUS CODES" below.
# 
#        4NN text
# 
#        5NN text
#               Reject  the  address etc. that matches the pattern,
#               and respond with the numerical three-digit code and
#               text.  4NN means "try again later", while 5NN means
#               "do not try again".
# 
#               The following responses have  special  meaning  for
#               the Postfix SMTP server:
# 
#               421 text (Postfix 2.3 and later)
# 
#               521 text (Postfix 2.6 and later)
#                      After    responding   with   the   numerical
#                      three-digit code and text, disconnect  imme-
#                      diately from the SMTP client.  This frees up
#                      SMTP server resources so that  they  can  be
#                      made available to another SMTP client.
# 
#                      Note: The "521" response should be used only
#                      with botnets and other malware where  inter-
#                      operability is of no concern.  The "send 521
#                      and disconnect" behavior is NOT  defined  in
#                      the SMTP standard.
# 
#        REJECT optional text...
#               Reject  the  address etc. that matches the pattern.
#               Reply   with   "$access_map_reject_code    optional
#               text..."  when the optional text is specified, oth-
#               erwise reply with a generic error response message.
# 
#        DEFER optional text...
#               Reject  the  address etc. that matches the pattern.
#               Reply   with    "$access_map_defer_code    optional
#               text..."  when the optional text is specified, oth-
#               erwise reply with a generic error response message.
# 
#               This feature is available in Postfix 2.6 and later.
# 
#        DEFER_IF_REJECT optional text...
#               Defer the request if some later  restriction  would
#               result    in    a   REJECT   action.   Reply   with
#               "$access_map_defer_code  4.7.1  optional   text..."
#               when  the  optional  text  is  specified, otherwise
#               reply with a generic error response message.
# 
#               Prior to Postfix 2.6, the SMTP reply code is 450.
# 
#               This feature is available in Postfix 2.1 and later.
# 
#        DEFER_IF_PERMIT optional text...
#               Defer  the  request if some later restriction would
#               result in a an explicit or implicit PERMIT  action.
#               Reply  with "$access_map_defer_code 4.7.1  optional
#               text..." when the optional text is specified,  oth-
#               erwise reply with a generic error response message.
# 
#               Prior to Postfix 2.6, the SMTP reply code is 450.
# 
#               This feature is available in Postfix 2.1 and later.
# 
#        For other reject actions, see "OTHER ACTIONS" below.
# 
# OTHER ACTIONS
#        restriction...
#               Apply the named UCE restriction(s) (permit, reject,
#               reject_unauth_destination, and so on).
# 
#        BCC user@domain
#               Send one copy  of  the  message  to  the  specified
#               recipient.
# 
#               If  multiple  BCC  actions are specified within the
#               same SMTP MAIL transaction, with Postfix  3.0  only
#               the last action will be used.
# 
#               This feature is available in Postfix 3.0 and later.
# 
#        DISCARD optional text...
#               Claim successful delivery and silently discard  the
#               message.   Log the optional text if specified, oth-
#               erwise log a generic message.
# 
#               Note: this action currently affects all  recipients
#               of  the  message.   To  discard  only one recipient
#               without discarding  the  entire  message,  use  the
#               transport(5) table to direct mail to the discard(8)
#               service.
# 
#               This feature is available in Postfix 2.0 and later.
# 
#        DUNNO  Pretend  that  the  lookup  key was not found. This
#               prevents Postfix  from  trying  substrings  of  the
#               lookup  key (such as a subdomain name, or a network
#               address subnetwork).
# 
#               This feature is available in Postfix 2.0 and later.
# 
#        FILTER transport:destination
#               After  the  message is queued, send the entire mes-
#               sage through the specified external content filter.
#               The  transport  name specifies the first field of a
#               mail delivery agent definition  in  master.cf;  the
#               syntax  of the next-hop destination is described in
#               the  manual  page  of  the  corresponding  delivery
#               agent.   More  information  about  external content
#               filters is in the Postfix FILTER_README file.
# 
#               Note 1: do not use $number regular expression  sub-
#               stitutions  for transport or destination unless you
#               know that the information has a trusted origin.
# 
#               Note 2: this  action  overrides  the  main.cf  con-
#               tent_filter  setting, and affects all recipients of
#               the message.  In  the  case  that  multiple  FILTER
#               actions fire, only the last one is executed.
# 
#               Note  3:  the  purpose  of the FILTER command is to
#               override message routing.  To override the  recipi-
#               ent's  transport  but not the next-hop destination,
#               specify an empty filter  destination  (Postfix  2.7
#               and later), or specify a transport:destination that
#               delivers  through  a  different  Postfix   instance
#               (Postfix  2.6 and earlier). Other options are using
#               the recipient-dependent transport_maps or the  sen-
#               der-dependent   sender_dependent_default_transport-
#               _maps features.
# 
#               This feature is available in Postfix 2.0 and later.
# 
#        HOLD optional text...
#               Place  the message on the hold queue, where it will
#               sit until someone either deletes it or releases  it
#               for  delivery.  Log the optional text if specified,
#               otherwise log a generic message.
# 
#               Mail that is placed on hold can  be  examined  with
#               the  postcat(1)  command,  and  can be destroyed or
#               released with the postsuper(1) command.
# 
#               Note: use "postsuper -r" to release mail  that  was
#               kept  on  hold for a significant fraction of $maxi-
#               mal_queue_lifetime  or  $bounce_queue_lifetime,  or
#               longer.  Use "postsuper -H" only for mail that will
#               not expire within a few delivery attempts.
# 
#               Note: this action currently affects all  recipients
#               of the message.
# 
#               This feature is available in Postfix 2.0 and later.
# 
#        PREPEND headername: headervalue
#               Prepend the specified message header  to  the  mes-
#               sage.   When more than one PREPEND action executes,
#               the first prepended header appears before the  sec-
#               ond etc. prepended header.
# 
#               Note:  this  action must execute before the message
#               content is received; it cannot execute in the  con-
#               text of smtpd_end_of_data_restrictions.
# 
#               This feature is available in Postfix 2.1 and later.
# 
#        REDIRECT user@domain
#               After the message is queued, send  the  message  to
#               the  specified  address  instead  of  the  intended
#               recipient(s).  When multiple REDIRECT actions fire,
#               only the last one takes effect.
# 
#               Note:  this action overrides the FILTER action, and
#               currently overrides all recipients of the  message.
# 
#               This feature is available in Postfix 2.1 and later.
# 
#        INFO optional text...
#               Log an informational record with the optional text,
#               together  with client information and if available,
#               with helo, sender, recipient and protocol  informa-
#               tion.
# 
#               This feature is available in Postfix 3.0 and later.
# 
#        WARN optional text...
#               Log a warning with the optional text, together with
#               client  information  and  if  available, with helo,
#               sender, recipient and protocol information.
# 
#               This feature is available in Postfix 2.1 and later.
# 
# ENHANCED STATUS CODES
#        Postfix  version  2.3  and  later  support enhanced status
#        codes as defined in RFC 3463.   When  an  enhanced  status
#        code  is  specified  in  an access table, it is subject to
#        modification. The  following  transformations  are  needed
#        when  the  same  access  table  is  used for client, helo,
#        sender, or  recipient  access  restrictions;  they  happen
#        regardless of whether Postfix replies to a MAIL FROM, RCPT
#        TO or other SMTP command.
# 
#        o      When a sender address matches a REJECT action,  the
#               Postfix  SMTP server will transform a recipient DSN
#               status (e.g., 4.1.1-4.1.6) into  the  corresponding
#               sender DSN status, and vice versa.
# 
#        o      When   non-address  information  matches  a  REJECT
#               action (such as the HELO command  argument  or  the
#               client  hostname/address),  the Postfix SMTP server
#               will transform a sender  or  recipient  DSN  status
#               into   a  generic  non-address  DSN  status  (e.g.,
#               4.0.0).
# 
# REGULAR EXPRESSION TABLES
#        This section describes how the table lookups  change  when
#        the table is given in the form of regular expressions. For
#        a description of regular expression lookup  table  syntax,
#        see regexp_table(5) or pcre_table(5).
# 
#        Each  pattern  is  a regular expression that is applied to
#        the entire string being looked up. Depending on the appli-
#        cation,  that  string  is  an  entire  client hostname, an
#        entire client IP address, or an entire mail address. Thus,
#        no  parent  domain  or  parent  network  search  is  done,
#        user@domain mail addresses are not broken  up  into  their
#        user@ and domain constituent parts, nor is user+foo broken
#        up into user and foo.
# 
#        Patterns are applied in the order as specified in the  ta-
#        ble,  until  a  pattern  is  found that matches the search
#        string.
# 
#        Actions are the same as with indexed  file  lookups,  with
#        the  additional feature that parenthesized substrings from
#        the pattern can be interpolated as $1, $2 and so on.
# 
# TCP-BASED TABLES
#        This section describes how the table lookups  change  when
#        lookups are directed to a TCP-based server. For a descrip-
#        tion of the TCP client/server lookup protocol, see tcp_ta-
#        ble(5).  This feature is not available up to and including
#        Postfix version 2.4.
# 
#        Each lookup operation uses the entire query  string  once.
#        Depending  on  the  application,  that string is an entire
#        client hostname, an entire client IP address, or an entire
#        mail  address.   Thus,  no parent domain or parent network
#        search is done, user@domain mail addresses are not  broken
#        up  into  their user@ and domain constituent parts, nor is
#        user+foo broken up into user and foo.
# 
#        Actions are the same as with indexed file lookups.
# 
# EXAMPLE
#        The following example uses an indexed file,  so  that  the
#        order  of  table entries does not matter. The example per-
#        mits access by the client at address 1.2.3.4  but  rejects
#        all  other  clients  in 1.2.3.0/24. Instead of hash lookup
#        tables, some systems use dbm.  Use the  command  "postconf
#        -m"  to  find  out  what lookup tables Postfix supports on
#        your system.
# 
#        /etc/postfix/main.cf:
#            smtpd_client_restrictions =
#                check_client_access hash:/etc/postfix/access
# 
#        /etc/postfix/access:
#            1.2.3   REJECT
#            1.2.3.4 OK
# 
#        Execute the command  "postmap  /etc/postfix/access"  after
#        editing the file.
# 
# BUGS
#        The  table format does not understand quoting conventions.
