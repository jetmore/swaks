# this is documented in test.txt too, but to document as close to the issue as possible, this doesn't actually work.
# Because "no_" sorts before "show_", this is equivilant to '--no-show-time-lapse --show-time-lapse'.  Since
# "no-" has to be after what it's unsetting, it doesn't work.  I've documented this in base.pod. Just leaving this
# test around in case the behavior ever changes
