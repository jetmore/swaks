blank lines and commented (w/ #) lines are skipped
continuation lines work (lines that end in '\' are combined with the following line

Tokens:
	%SWAKS%        - will be replaced with the path to swaks. If $TEST_SWAKS is defined it will be used for %SWAKS%
	%TESTID%       - The current test ID.  This is defined as the filename, minus the .test extension.  Almost always (and preferably) numeric,
	                 it is possible to use alpha chars if there's some reason.
	%TESTDIR%      - the path to the base of the currently running test suite
	%OUTDIR%       - the path to dynamic files (output of swaks from the test run, dynamically-generated configs, etc). By convention, this
	                 directory will not be versioned.  defined as %TESTDIR%/out-dyn
	%REFDIR%       - the path to static reference files.  These are the "blessed" output of the command, used as a reference to make sure a given
	                 execution is producing the correct results.  Contents will be versioned.  defined as %TESTDIR%/out-ref
	%QUOTE_SINGLE% - will be replaced with a single-quote (') after the line is split into its component parts but before the line
	                 is considered for evaluation.  This is a way to avoid using backslashes for quoting complex lines, which is
	                 especially useful on Windows, where the backslash is also used for paths.
	%QUOTE_DOUBLE% - equivalent to %QUOTE_SINGLE%, but will be replaced with a double-quote (").

Line definition:
	type: ARGUMENTS

types:
	"pre action"  - the VERB is an action.  Will be performed before testing. If more than one, will be performed in order encountered in file.
	"once action" - the VERB is an action.  This is an action that is performed once and only once for the entire call to run-tests.pl.  This
	                can be used to set up test environments that are dynamic enough that they can't be put in git, but static enough that
	                they only need to be done once per test suite execution.  Will be performed before testing. If more than one, will be
	                performed in order encountered in file.
	"auto"        - The verb is a comma-delimited list of "standard" actions, followed by a space-delimited list of files.  Exact actions
	                listed under "auto actions" below
	"test action" - This is the action that is executing the actual test.  This action is no different than "pre action", it's just
	                definied differently to make it easier to read and to make it obvious that it ALWAYS happens after "pre action", even if
	                it's defined in the file before a "pre action"
	"test result" - This defines an action that will determine whether the test passed or not. This really only works for one "test result",
	                and really only diff right now.
	"title"       - deprecated. Replaced by tracking test purposes in a suite's test.txt file
	"skip"        - if present, the test will be skipped.  In the results it will be listed as a skip and the ARGUMENTS will be displayed
	                as the reason why
	"debug"       - comma-delimited list of debugging output to include or "ALL".
	                Currently supported arguments:
	                  "action" - prints a message any time an action is processed
	                  "result" - prints a message any time a result is processed
	                  "exec"   - any time run-tests.pl is going to execute a process, print what will be executed
	                  VERB     - Any of the action of result verbs can be used, in which case more detailed info about the
	                             execution of that verb will be printed

Test execution order:
	skip        - if present, test is skipped, regardless of any other content
	once action - next any "once action"s are processed.  They are processed in the order encountered in the file
	pre action  - next any "pre action"s are processed.  They are processed in the order encountered in the file
	test action - next any "test action"s are processed.  They are processed in the order encountered in the file
	test result - next any "test results"s are processed.  They are processed in the order encountered in the file
	            (note that though it's designed to process multiple, it only works for one right now)


Conditional execution:
	Any line can have a string matching IFOS=[OSSTRING] or IFOS!=[OSSTRING].  [OSSTRING] is in the format returned
	by $^O by perl.  If the line matches the pattern but not the condition, the line will be discarded entirely.
	If the line matches the pattern and the condition, the matching pattern is removed and the line is processed normally.
	This can be used to perform platform specific tests.  For instance, locale strings are different between Linux
	and Windows, which can be accounted for like so:

		pre action: IFOS=MSWin32 SET_ENV LC_ALL Czech
		pre action: IFOS!=MSWin32 SET_ENV LC_ALL cs_CZ.UTF-8

	The entire test can be skipped in the same way using the skip command:

		skip: IFOS=MSWin32 Test is not applicable for Windows
		skip: IFOS!=MSWin32 Test is only applicable for Windows


auto actions
	REMOVE_FILE
		Assumes space-delimited list following actions is a list of FILEs
		For each file FILE, add a "pre action: REMOVE_FILE %OUTDIR%/FILE" line

	CREATE_FILE
		Assumes space-delimited list following actions is a list of FILEs
		For each file FILE, add a "pre action: CREATE_FILE %REFDIR%/FILE" line

	MUNGE
		Assumes space-delimited list following actions is a list of FILEs
		For each file FILE, add a "test action: MUNGE file:%OUTDIR%/FILE munge_standard" line

	COMPARE_FILE
		Assumes space-delimited list following actions is a list of FILEs
		For each file FILE, add a "test result: COMPARE_FILE %REFDIR%/FILE %OUTDIR%/FILE" line

	INTERACT
		This command is used to spawn a command and provide it input on stdin based on prompts
		Assumes first element of space-delimited list following actions is a command to spawn (COMMAND)
		After that, the space delimited list is expected to contain pairs, with the first being prompt
		  and the second being response (PROMPT_n, RESPONSE_n)
		Each INTERACT line adds the following lines:
			pre action: REMOVE_FILE %OUTDIR%/%TESTID%.expect
			pre action: MERGE %OUTDIR%/%TESTID%.expect string:'spawn COMMAND\\n' \
			            string:'expect "PROMPT_1"\\n' string:'send -- "RESPONSE_1\\r"\\n' \
			            string:'expect "PROMPT_N"\\n' string:'send -- "RESPONSE_N\\r"\\n' \
			            string:'interact\\n'
			test action: CMD_CAPTURE expect %OUTDIR%/%TESTID%.expect



Action verbs:
	REMOVE_FILE FILE [FILE ...]
		unlink the specified file(s)

	CMD EXECUTE STRING
		executes the command and arguments.  This is NOT executed by a shell

	CMD_CAPTURE EXECUTE STRING
		same as CMD but stdout and stderr will be automatically captured to %OUTDIR%/%TESTID%.stdout and .stderr. Because these
		file paths are static, this is really only usable once per test run. Room for improvement there...
		Note that if the execute string contains a component that looks like STDIN:/path/to/file.txt, the executed command will
		have its STDIN attached to /path/to/file.txt.  Similarly, "STDIN:LITERAL:some\ntext\n" will send "some\ntext\n" to
		the executed command's STDIN, with the '\'+'n' characters replaces with real newlines.

	CREATE_FILE FILE
		touch a file (but only if FILE does not already exist). mostly useful for making sure test files exist even if there's
		an execution error that prevents them from being created (prevents diff from barfing)

	DEFINE TOKEN VALUE
		defines a value for TOKEN than can be used in other commands

	SET_ENV VAR CONTENTS
	SET_ENV VAR "--UNSET--"
		set an environment variable.  Useful for testing enviroment variables affecting the test command. After each test case is executed,
		does its best to restore the environment to pre-testcase values so that env configs from one test don't bleed over to another.
		As a special case, if the CONTENTS is "--UNSET--", the environment variable will be removed entirely (as distinct from setting to
		an empty value).

	MERGE OUTPUTFILE PART [PART ...]
		Take all the PARTs, concatenate them, and put them in OUTPUTFILE.  PARTs must have a prefix.  "file:/path/to/file" indicated that
		/path/to/prefix is a file, and the file contents should be used.  "string:'some text'" indicates that "some text" should be used as
		the content.  mode:### indicates that the file's mode should be changed after writing (should be octal, like 0644).  owner:###
		indicates that the file's owner should be changed after writing.  group:### indicates that the file's group should be changed
		after writing. Owner and group are currently numeric only.

	MUNGE file:FILE MUNGEVALUE
		Oof, this is overly complex.  This is a filter for the FILE indicated by file:FILE.  That FILE will be opened, the requested munges
		will be applied to each line in the file (potentially) and the munged contents written back to FILE.  This is used to remove run-specific
		output from the output files (dates, etc).
		The actual MUNGEVALUE is EITHER TYPE,IF,FIND,REPLACE OR "munge_standard".
			TYPE:         munge_general, munge_globs, munge_mime_boundaries, munge_version, munge_dates, munge_message_ids, munge_paths,
			              munge_local_hostname
			IF:           this is a pattern that is applied to the entire line. If the IF doesn't match, munging isn't attempted
			FIND/REPLACE: If IF matched, then FIND is looked for.  If FIND matches, everything FIND matches is replaced with REPLACE
		Because this is so complex and new types often pop up as tests are pushed into new areas, "munge_standard" can be used to apply
		the standard set of munges to the file.  That way new standard munges can be added via run-tests.pl instead of modifying every
		test case file.  As of the time of writing, munge_standard is equivilent to:
			MUNGE file:FILE munge_standard
				MUNGE file:FILE "munge_globs"
				MUNGE file:FILE "munge_dates,'^(Subject|Date):'"
				MUNGE file:FILE "munge_message_ids,'^Message-Id:'"
				MUNGE file:FILE "munge_version,'X-Mailer'"
				MUNGE file:FILE "munge_paths"
				MUNGE file:FILE "munge_mime_boundaries"
				MUNGE file:FILE "munge_local_hostname"

Result verbs:
	COMPARE_FILE REFERENCE_FILE TEST_FILE
		Does a simple diff on the files.  If there's any output from the diff, it is a failure
