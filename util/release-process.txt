This file is used to document the formal release process.  Populate
the next time I do a real release.  Needed because I apparently forgot
to manually update the "Change Summary" section of RELEASE/README.txt.


# Choose a release
export RELEASE=20201014.0
export SWAKSDIR=/Users/jetmore/Documents/git/swaks
export BUILDDIR=$SWAKSDIR/tmp

# We will be releasing what's in the develop branch
# create a branch from develop named release/v$RELEASE
git fetch
git checkout develop
git pull
git checkout -b release/v$RELEASE

# review deprecations
  - base.pod.  Make sure new deprecations are present.  Update the "not before" date
  - remove code/docs/tests for any functionality that has reached its not-before date
  - add Changes entry for any removed functionality

# Update Changes, add a release entry

# run automated testing
## run all tests non-interactively
TEST_SWAKS=../../swaks bin/run-all.pl
## rerun any failed tests in interactive mode
TEST_SWAKS=../../swaks bin/run-all.pl --errors

# run manual testing
## see steps in testing/MANUAL.txt

# Generate a skeleton of the announce blog post.  Don't publish it yet, but you should
# draft and save it so you can have the URL for the following docs
https://www.jetmore.org/john/blog/2020/10/swaks-release-20201014-0-available/

# update README.md

# update App-swaks/Changes (in general this will only ever be "repackaging of version blah blah blah".  Only thing else would be changes specifically related to packaging)

# update App-swaks/Makefile.PL (version)

# update App-swaks/README (version and copyright year)

# update doc/index.html

# update doc/versions.html

# update doc/installation.html (fix the links in the direct-download examples to include the latest version, also the link to App::swaks)

# open doc/versions.html, doc/index.html, and installation.html in a browser and make sure everything looks ok

# Run the spell checker
# aspell --personal to set a personal wordlist doesn't seem to work, but using the "default"
# personal word list does.  So change where aspell looks for the default personal word list
# setting $HOME
# alias aspell=~/Documents/dev/bin/aspell

# Can save changes directly:
HOME=$SWAKSDIR/util aspell check Changes
HOME=$SWAKSDIR/util aspell --mode perl check swaks
HOME=$SWAKSDIR/util aspell --mode html check doc/faq.html
HOME=$SWAKSDIR/util aspell --mode html check doc/index.html
HOME=$SWAKSDIR/util aspell --mode html check doc/installation.html
HOME=$SWAKSDIR/util aspell check RELEASE/README.txt
HOME=$SWAKSDIR/util aspell check doc/recipes.pod
HOME=$SWAKSDIR/util aspell check doc/base.pod
HOME=$SWAKSDIR/util aspell check App-swaks/Changes
HOME=$SWAKSDIR/util aspell check App-swaks/README
HOME=$SWAKSDIR/util aspell --mode markdown check README.md

# run the actual script (this preps some stuff, but this won't be the final release):
$SWAKSDIR/util/gen-release.pl $RELEASE

# review RELEASE/README.txt and update with detailed changes and high-level overview of release

HOME=$SWAKSDIR/util aspell check RELEASE/README.txt

# Create the release gz and post on the website
# this tar command is for macos.  linux would not need the env variable and would use --transform instead of -s
/bin/rm $BUILDDIR/swaks-$RELEASE.tar.gz
COPYFILE_DISABLE=1 tar -cvzf $BUILDDIR/swaks-$RELEASE.tar.gz -s/^RELEASE/swaks-$RELEASE/ --exclude '._*' RELEASE
scp $BUILDDIR/swaks-$RELEASE.tar.gz ftp.jetmore.org:jetmore.org/john/code/swaks/files

# Build the perl distribution

# we rebuild these each time and already store a "release" copy in RELEASE, no reason to store them here too
/bin/rm swaks LICENSE

# unpack files on the server and set up the "latest" link
ssh ftp.jetmore.org /bin/tar -xzvf jetmore.org/john/code/swaks/files/swaks-$RELEASE.tar.gz -C jetmore.org/john/code/swaks/files

###
# At this point the release files are published on the server but nothing's pointing to them yet.  Audit
# links in the unpublished blog post, README.md, index.html, etc to make sure they will work

# start actually publishing
scp doc/index.html ftp.jetmore.org:jetmore.org/john/code/swaks/index.html
scp doc/versions.html ftp.jetmore.org:jetmore.org/john/code/swaks/versions.html
scp doc/faq.html ftp.jetmore.org:jetmore.org/john/code/swaks/faq.html
scp doc/installation.html ftp.jetmore.org:jetmore.org/john/code/swaks/installation.html

### publish the perl package to cpan
# requires `cpan install CPAN::Uploader`
# `perl -MConfig -e 'Config::config_vars(qw(prefix));'` for probable install location
# see https://metacpan.org/pod/distribution/CPAN-Uploader/bin/cpan-upload for format of .pause
/usr/local/Cellar/perl/5.32.0/bin/cpan-upload --config $BUILDDIR/.pause $BUILDDIR/App-swaks-$RELEASE.tar.gz

(recommend updating the links in this file and saving before actually doing this git stuff)

git fetch
git checkout master
git pull
git merge --no-ff release/v$RELEASE

git tag -a v$RELEASE -m "Tagging the $RELEASE release"
git push origin v$RELEASE

# merge release branch into develop (there can be conflicts here)
