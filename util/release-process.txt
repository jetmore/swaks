This file is used to document the formal release process.  Populate
the next time I do a real release.  Needed because I apparently forgot
to manually update the "Change Summary" section of RELEASE/README.txt.


# Choose a release
export RELEASE=20190914.0
export SWAKSDIR=/Users/jetmore/Documents/git/swaks

# We will be releasing what's in the develop branch
# create a branch from develop named release/$RELEASE

# Update Changes, add a release entry

# Generate a skeleton of the announce blog post.  Don't publish it yet, but you should
# draft and save it so you can have the URL for the following docs

# update README.md

# update doc/index.html

# update doc/versions.html

# open doc/versions.html and doc/index.html in a browser and make sure everything looks ok

# Run the spell checker
# aspell --personal to set a personal wordlist doesn't seem to work, but using the "default"
# personal word list does.  So change where aspell looks for the default personal word list
# setting $HOME
# alias aspell=~/Documents/dev/bin/aspell

# Can save changes directly:
HOME=$SWAKSDIR/util aspell check Changes
HOME=$SWAKSDIR/util aspell --mode perl check swaks
HOME=$SWAKSDIR/util aspell --mode html check doc/faq.html
HOME=$SWAKSDIR/util aspell --mode html check doc/index.html
HOME=$SWAKSDIR/util aspell check RELEASE/README.txt
HOME=$SWAKSDIR/util aspell check doc/recipes.pod
HOME=$SWAKSDIR/util aspell check doc/base.pod
HOME=$SWAKSDIR/util aspell check doc/installation.pod
HOME=$SWAKSDIR/util aspell --mode markdown check README.md

# run the actual script (this preps some stuff, but this won't be the final release):
$SWAKSDIR/util/gen-release.pl $RELEASE

# review RELEASE/README.txt and update with detailed changes and high-level overview of release

aspell check RELEASE/README.txt

# Create the release gz and post on the website
mv RELEASE swaks-$RELEASE
COPYFILE_DISABLE=1 tar -cvzf swaks-$RELEASE.tar.gz --exclude '._*' swaks-$RELEASE
mv swaks-$RELEASE RELEASE
scp swaks-$RELEASE.tar.gz ftp.jetmore.org:jetmore.org/john/code/swaks/files
rm swaks-$RELEASE.tar.gz

# unpack files on the server and set up the "latest" link
ssh ftp.jetmore.org /bin/tar -xzvf jetmore.org/john/code/swaks/files/swaks-$RELEASE.tar.gz -C jetmore.org/john/code/swaks/files
ssh ftp.jetmore.org /bin/rm jetmore.org/john/code/swaks/latest jetmore.org/john/code/swaks/latest.tar.gz
ssh ftp.jetmore.org /bin/ln -s files/swaks-$RELEASE /home/jetmore/jetmore.org/john/code/swaks/latest
ssh ftp.jetmore.org /bin/ln -s files/swaks-$RELEASE.tar.gz /home/jetmore/jetmore.org/john/code/swaks/latest.tar.gz

###
# At this point the release files are published on the server but nothing's pointing to them yet.  Audit
# links in the unpublished blog post, README.md, index.html, etc to make sure they will work

# start actually publishing
scp doc/index.html ftp.jetmore.org:jetmore.org/john/code/swaks/index.html
scp doc/versions.html ftp.jetmore.org:jetmore.org/john/code/swaks/versions.html
scp doc/faq.html ftp.jetmore.org:jetmore.org/john/code/swaks/faq.html

# tag the release and merge the release branch into master
git fetch
git checkout master
git pull
git merge --no-ff release/v$RELEASE
git push
git tag -a v$RELEASE -m "Tagging the $RELEASE release"
git push origin v$RELEASE

# merge release branch into develop (there can be conflicts here)
git checkout develop
git pull
git merge --no-ff release/v$RELEASE
git push

###
# To this point we're published but we haven't told anyone yet.  Start sending actual announcements:

# publish the draft blog post

# send twitter notification
